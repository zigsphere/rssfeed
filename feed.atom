Fire crews were able to stop the spread of the fire in a timely fashion with the use of a single hose line.  Unfortunately, the contents of the house suffered significant damage.
DCFD2 and WDFD responded to this incident with 2 fire engines, 1 ambulance and 2 command units with a total of 13 personnel. Crews were unable to determine a cause of the fire. Crews were assisted by Winston PD, Avista Gas, PP&L and Umpqua Valley Ambulance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ROSEBURG, Ore. - An adult male who had been in custody at the Douglas County Jail died at Mercy Medical Center on Monday.
On Monday, April 15, 2024, deputies in the jail found 33-year-old Derek Michael Ruh unconscious and unresponsive in his bunk. Deputies initiated resuscitative efforts and dialed 9-1-1 for an ambulance. Once EMS arrived on scene, they took over lifesaving efforts and transported Ruh to Mercy Medical Center. Ruh was later pronounced deceased at the hospital. 
The Douglas County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating the death. On Tuesday, April 16, 2024, an autopsy was conducted at the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office. Full toxicological screening is pending, but Ruh's death is suspected to be the results of a drug overdose. 
Drug overdose deaths within the community have increased significantly over the past several years. Each overdose death is heartbreaking and has a profound impact on the lives lost and those who knew them.
"I send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Ruh," Sheriff John Hanlin remarked.
Ruh had been taken into custody by the Roseburg Police Department on Sunday, April 14, 2024, shortly after 10:00 pm. He was being held at the Douglas County Jail on an arrest warrant out of Linn County.]]></summary>
