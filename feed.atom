        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[𝐃𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐋𝐀𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐓𝐘, 𝐎𝐫𝐞. - Since 2019, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office - 911 Communications Division has had the ability to receive Text-to-911.
Text-to-911 is an important service. It is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak due to an emergency, such as a home invasion or abusive partner. Additionally, individuals that are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may benefit from this technology.
A few things you should know about how Text-to-911 works:
• Texting to 911 is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak in an emergency. The key thing to remember is “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.
• When texting to 911 for an emergency the first message should be the location of the emergency (including city) and the type of emergency help needed (police, fire, or medical).
• Keep text messages brief and concise; using full words.
• Stay with your phone, be prepared to answer questions and follow instructions from the 911 dispatcher.
• Photos and videos should not be sent to 911 because not all wireless carriers are able to support this feature and it can delay dispatchers in sending help to you.
• You cannot include 911 in a group text or while roaming.
Some jurisdictions are unable to accept Text-to-911. If you send a text to 911 from a wireless carrier or a city/county without Text-to-911 service, you should receive a message saying that there is no text service to 911 available at this time.
Please remember, “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.]]></summary>

Public hearings scheduled for wildfire prevention and certified burn manager proposed rules
SALEM, Ore. — Public hearings are scheduled July 30 to gather feedback on administrative rules packages expanding and updating wildfire prevention restrictions, the Certified Burn Manager Program, and establishing the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program.
The Board of Forestry approved the public hearing process for the proposed rule packages during their June 5 meeting: 

629-025-0040 to 629-025-0050
629-042-1005 to 629-042-1065
629-042-2000 to 629-042-2060
629-043-0020 to 629-043-0030
629-047-0010 to 629-047-0100

See the agency’s rules website to access notices of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. The department consulted a Rulemaking Advisory Committee representing a wide variety of stakeholder interests while drafting the proposed rules. 
The prevention rules align fire prevention, equipment requirements for fire suppression and use of fireworks on public lands to increase wildfire prevention efforts. Certified Burn Manager proposed rules intend to advance the maturity of the Certified Burn Manager Program. Proposed rules also establish the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program described in Senate Bill 80 (2023) and HB 4016 (2024).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dufur, Ore. – Throughout the evening winds subsided and the Larch Creek Fire growth slowed. Dozers working through the night made good progress putting in control line and engines patrolled near homes in the fire area.  
Today structure task forces will continue to mop up and secure around homes in the fire area. Firefighters will be putting in hose lays and working with engines and water tenders to strengthen control lines. Dozers and crews will work on establishing line around the fire footprint on the east side of Highway 197. Air resources continue to be available and will engage as needed throughout the day.  
The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Incident Management Team 2 will shadow the Central Oregon IMT today. This evening at 6 p.m. ODF Team 2 and OSFM Green Team will officially transition into unified command. A huge Thank You to the Central Oregon Type 3 Interagency IMT for their coordination and efforts on this quickly emerging incident. 
The weather will moderate today with temperatures in the low 90’s with afternoon winds that should moderate into the evening. The next few days should see temperatures continuing to decrease and less substantial winds in the fire area, a very welcome forecast for firefighters. Yesterday there was one firefighter with heat related injuries who was transported to a local hospital.

The award recognizes Oxendine’s exceptional contributions to urban and community forestry, including his work as president of the non-profit OCT in 2022-23.

Both awards are in addition to his work with the City of Talent to restore tree canopy after the Almeda Fire, which led to the City’s being named by the Oregon Dept. of Forestry as Oregon Tree City of the Year in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dufur, Ore. – With a Red Flag warning across the fire area yesterday the high winds, high temperatures and low relative humidity moved the Larch Creek Fire across Highway 197 and continued its fast-moving growth to the east Wednesday evening. The Wasco County Sheriffs Office and the Incident Commanders of the Unified Command, Central Oregon Type 3 Interagency Incident Management Team and Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Green Team worked together to quickly elevate the evacuation levels. 
The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Team 2 has been ordered and will be arriving this morning. They will be in unified command with OSFM Green Team starting tomorrow evening.
Air resources, structure task forces, dozers, engines and handcrews worked tirelessly throughout the day.  Resources will remain engaged throughout the night, protecting structures and building fireline. 
Stay informed on updated evacuation alerts here:

A Red Cross shelter is open at Maupin High School for all community members effected by the current evacuations.
 Sherman County Fairgrounds is open for evacuation of livestock and pets. Hood River Fairgrounds is also open to displaced animals. Hwy 197 is being closely monitored and may be closed or have traffic control, check Trip Check for updates. Road & Weather Conditions Map | TripCheck - Oregon Traveler Information
Local fire danger levels are “extreme”, everyone is strongly encouraged to realize the current danger of how quickly a fire can start; it only takes one spark. Please do your part, do not park or drive on dry grass, know the current fire restrictions and prepare yourself with a shovel, water and fire extinguisher when outdoors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dalles, Ore. – Firefighters from the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District, U.S. Forest Service, local fire districts and landowners have quickly responded to a wildfire near Friend, OR. Firefighters are under initial attack and will continue operations into the night. The fire is currently burning with moderate-to-high spread, estimated at 3,500 acres in grass and timber fuel types. Containment is at 0%. 
The Larch Creek Fire is located 5 miles southwest of Dufur, OR near Friend, OR. It is burning southeast of Winslow Road in Township 2S Range 13E, which is west of Highway 97.
Last reported resources: 8 engines, 20-person hand crew from USFS Mt Hood, 4 dozers, local landowner resources, and multiple air resources. A Type 3 Central Oregon Fire Management Service team has been ordered and is in route. 
With high temperatures, low humidity, and difficult terrain, suppression efforts are requiring diverse methods of attack, prioritizing safety while protecting life and structures. Increased winds are playing a significant factor in fire behavior. No structures have been reported lost.
Evacuations: Level 3 - GO NOW - Evacuate from Clark Miller Road east to Hix Rd, North to Kingley-Friend Market Rd., South to Badger Creek Rd.
Level 2 - BE SET to evacuate from the following areas: Mc Corkle Rd south to Happy Ridge Rd, East to J Hix Rd, West to FS Rd 2700.
Level 1 - BE READY in Tygh Valley, Pine Hollow, and Wamic.
The Wasco County Fairgrounds is a temporarily designated evacuation point for livestock. A Red Cross Evacuation Shelter is opening at Maupin High School.
https://www.facebook.com/WascoCountySheriff or the Wasco County Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/wascocounty/ 
The fire started sometime around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9, 2024. The cause is under investigation.]]></summary>
