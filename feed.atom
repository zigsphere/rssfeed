The investigation began in October of this year when it was alleged 35 year old David Ralston was illegally possessing, producing, and selling firearms from his residence in the 400 block of Division Street in Drain.  Over the course of the following several weeks, detectives obtained evidence of Ralston's alleged illegal gun sales.  In November, detectives seized an unserialized AR-15 style rifle alleged to have been produced and sold by Ralston.  In December, detectives obtained information alleging Ralston had created an unserialized Glock style handgun, and it was ready to be purchased by a prospective buyer.
