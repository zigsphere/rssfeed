As officers on scene attempted contact with Bobo, they heard what sounded like a single gunshot from inside Bobo’s vehicle.  After several attempts and no communication from Bobo, a drone was deployed and observed no movement from Bobo inside the vehicle.
Officers approached the vehicle and determined Bobo was deceased from a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound. Detectives and the Douglas County Medicolegal Death Investigator took over the scene.
The alleyway between the 900 block of S.E. Pine and S.E. Stephens streets was affected for approximately two hours.  There is no ongoing threat to the public and no additional information will be provided at this time.
