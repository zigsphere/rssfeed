The committee’s agenda includes:

Oregon Forest Land Protection Fund proposed rules
Eligibility of firefighting costs policy
Guidelines for eligibility of firefighting costs for the Oregon Forest Land Protection Fund Directive

The meeting is open to the public to attend virtually via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted near the end of the meeting. Accommodations for people with disabilities, and special materials, services, or assistance can be arranged by calling at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting at 503-945-7200 or by email at forestryinformation@odf.oregon.gov.
The Emergency Fire Cost Committee (EFCC) oversees the Oregon Forest Land Protection Fund (OFLPF), established by the Oregon Legislature as a fund with the purpose of equalizing emergency fire suppression costs among the various Oregon Department of Forestry protection districts and forest protective associations. All districts/associations contribute to the fund so that money will be available to any individual district/association to pay fire suppression costs on eligible emergency fires. View more information on the EFCC webpage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salem, Ore.— The Oregon Department of Forestry is happy to announce the launch of the Prescribed Fire Liability Program. This pilot program is intended to increase use of prescribed fire and cultural burning and support fire practitioners by providing liability coverage for enrolled burns.
Introducing periodic fire to fire-adapted landscapes and reducing forest fuels has been shown to lessen the potential for high-intensity wildfires and the large volume of smoke they produce. 
While the rates of escape and loss are very low due to the careful planning and preparation required for prescribed fire and cultural burning, there is always some residual risk when working with fire. This risk, and the resulting liability for damages due to escape if uninsured, can deter some practitioners from using beneficial fire.
Governor Kotek signed House Bill 4016 in 2024 establishing the pilot Prescribed Fire Liability Program. It authorizes claims covering certain losses arising from escaped prescribed fires and cultural burns. Participation in the program is voluntary.
For your burn to have liability coverage under the program, all the following conditions must be met: 

The burn is enrolled in the program prior to burning.
The burn is conducted or supervised by an appropriate party for the burn.
Ensure the burn follows all applicable laws related to the burn (obtain and follow any required permits/burn plan, make required notifications for Certified Burn Manager-led burns, additional paperwork/ submissions for Power Driven Machinery, etc.).
If the burn escapes, the fire must not be a result of willful, malicious, or negligent actions in the origin or subsequent spread.

Learn more about the program and apply at ODF’s Prescribed Fire Liability Program web page. 
For more information on prescribed fire and correlating programs, visit ODF’s Prescribed Fire web page.]]></summary>
