        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TOKETEE, Ore. - In coordination with fire managers, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office is downgrading all homes in the Slide Creek area downstream to the Soda Springs area to a Level 1 - Be Ready Notice. This in inclusive of all addresses between these two points. These residences were previously on a Level 2 - Be Set notice as a result of the Pine Bench Fire, which is part of the Diamond Complex.
A LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.
Although the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that there is a significant forest closure which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff's Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service. 
An interactive evacuation map can be found on our website at https://www.dcso.com/evacuations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During August through the end of September the Roseburg Police Department will have some extra patrols out working traffic enforcement, with a specific focus on safety belt use, distracted driving and speeding.  These focused patrols are made available due to grants received from Oregon Impact and the Oregon Department of Transportation.
Seat belts have been proven to be one of the best ways to save your life in a crash. Yet many still don’t buckle up. Worse still, not wearing a seat belt is a habit that will pass on to impressionable youth, who in turn will think it’s safe to not buckle up.
Distracted driving is one of the fastest growing safety issues on the roads today. Distracted drivers aren’t just a threat to themselves: they’re a danger to everyone else on the road. The national distracted driving effort focuses on ways to change the behavior of drivers through legislation, enforcement, public awareness, and education.
Be on the lookout for specific enforcement campaigns over the next two months.]]></summary>
