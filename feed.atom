        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At 8:29 p.m. on October 6, 2024, Roseburg Fire Department personnel responded to a commercial structure fire, located at 350 NE Pomona Street.  Several concerned citizens contacted the Douglas County Emergency Dispatch Center after both fire and smoke were showing from the commercial structure known as Gecko RV and Boat Storage.  Firefighters arrived on scene to find fire and heavy smoke showing from approximately fourteen storage units located within the storage unit complex.  
Firefighters conducted a search for potential occupants and quickly extinguished the fire. Firefighters used rotary saws to gain access through garage doors of individual storage units to check for fire and to confirm the fire was not spreading to additional units through the common attic space.  Six units suffered fire and smoke damage while numerous other units suffered smoke damage.  Firefighters were on scene for approximately four hours completing extensive overhaul of the damaged storage units. 
Throughout the day, fire investigators will be on scene processing several of the storage units.  The cause of the fire is undetermined at this time and is not criminal in nature.  There were no reported firefighter or civilian injuries.  Twenty-one firefighters assisted with firefighting operations.  Other agencies assisting with the fire included Central Douglas Fire & Rescue, Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power.
The Roseburg Fire Department would like to thank the citizens who quickly reported the fire to the Douglas County Emergency Dispatch Center.  Their quick action assisted in limiting the damage to additional storage units.
