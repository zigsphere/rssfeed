        <link href="https://www.flashalert.net/news.html?id=1072#news176255"/>
        <updated>2024-10-24T15:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) - Central Oregon District will officially reduce the fire danger to LOW and end the 2024 fire season Friday, October 25, 2024, at 12:01 a.m., for lands under their protection and management. The end of fire season is a result of recent wetting rains and an overall cooling trend that has returned to the area. 
With the end of fire season, the public and industrial fire restrictions implemented through the Central Oregon District will no longer be in effect.
Despite the fire season ending, fire officials advise residents to not rush burning. Instead, cover the top two-thirds of debris piles with a tarp or plastic. Doing this will keep the pile dry to allow for a cleaner burn later into the fall/winter months when the risk of fire spread is minimal. Several days of sunshine and dry weather during the fall months can create a fire risk even if a week or more of cool, wet conditions precede them.
Residents should contact their local fire department or ODF before conducting any type of debris burning as fire restrictions may vary between local fire districts. ODF offices are located in Sisters, 541-549-2731, Prineville 541-447-5658, The Dalles 541-296-4626, Fossil 541-763-2575 and John Day 541-575-1139.
When burning yard debris, ensure an adequate fire trail around the pile before igniting and have fire tools and a water supply at the burn site. Debris piles should never be left unattended and fully extinguished before leaving the area. If a debris burn escapes containment, the party responsible may be held financially responsible for the resulting fire suppression costs and associated damages.
The Central Oregon District staff would like to thank the community for their cooperation and support during the 2024 fire season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCOTTSBURG, Ore. - Detectives are investigating a fatal shooting incident that occurred on Monday in Scottsburg.
On Monday, October 21, 2024, at approximately 12:00 pm, deputies were responding to a reported criminal mischief and assault in the 5000 block of Lutsinger Creek Road.
While deputies were responding, 9-1-1 dispatchers received additional calls from the residents in the area reporting the incident was escalating and reports of gunshots heard.
When deputies arrived, they located 58-year-old Darrel Dow Dodd unconscious with apparent gunshot wounds. Deputies attempted lifesaving efforts, which were unsuccessful.
Detectives with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office and the Douglas County Medical Examiner's Office responded to the scene.
Through the investigation, it was learned that Dodd was armed with a weapon, had broken into a residence and began assaulting and strangling a female known to him while threatening to stab her. Another individual attempted to intervene, but Dodd continued his attack. Dodd was shot twice by a third individual.
Detectives are currently investigating the incident as a case of justified defense of another person, based upon the evidence and circumstances of the incident, although the investigation is ongoing. Once the investigation is complete, it will be forwarded to the Douglas County District Attorney's Office for review.]]></summary>
