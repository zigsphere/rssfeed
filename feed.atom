On Wednesday, January 3, 2024, Douglas County Sheriff's Deputies received a report that 44-year-old Uriah Shawn Strauss of Roseburg sent a letter to a minor child at a local high school. The letter outlined Strauss' desire to strike up a romantic relationship with a woman of at least 16-years of age.  
Strauss was located at the Roseburg Rescue Mission where he was interviewed and taken into custody for Attempted Unlawful Contact with a Child. 
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office previously notified the public that Strauss, a Level III sex offender, was sending letters that were filled with sexually explicit content, causing alarm and apprehension regarding personal safety to various women in and out of our community.
