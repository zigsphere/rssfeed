        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PENDLETON, Ore. – The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) has named Pendleton as Oregon’s Tree City of the Year. It’s an unusual honor given that the town in northeast Oregon is surrounded by rolling grasslands and was largely treeless except along the Umatilla River when Pendleton was laid out in 1868. Early city residents wasted no time planting trees to buffer the winds and offer shade from the area’s hot summers.
That tree-planting tradition has continued to this day. In partnership with the Umatilla National Forest and the volunteer-led Tree Commission, the city annually distributes free trees to residents during an Arbor Day celebration, giving away 250 last year and nearly 700 over the past 4 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - A cross country skier was rescued after falling and injuring her ankle Sunday afternoon.
On Sunday, March 31, 2024, at approximately 1:30 p.m. Douglas County 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a 57-year-old woman who fell and injured her ankle while cross country skiing near Mt. Thielsen with her companion. The victim was unable to bear weight on the injured leg and requested assistance.
Deputies activated the Douglas County Search & Rescue team who responded to the area along with volunteers from Diamond Lake Resort. Searchers used snowshoes to hike the four miles into the base of a tree line where they located the victim, Trina Reiter of Eugene and her companion just before 7:45 p.m. Searchers stabilized Reiter's injury, placed her in a litter and transported her back to the trailhead. They arrived at the trailhead shortly before 1:30 a.m., to a waiting ambulance. Reiter was evaluated by EMS at the scene and went to the hospital by private vehicle.
"This mission shows the dedication of our search and rescue deputies and volunteers who spent their Easter Sunday assisting someone in our community who was in need of their services," Lt. Brad O'Dell said. "This mission was very successful and Trina was extremely thankful for the care and compassion shown to her by Douglas County SAR and Diamond Lake Resort volunteers."
Douglas County SAR is a division of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office with approximately 90 active volunteers and two full-time Search and Rescue Deputies.]]></summary>
