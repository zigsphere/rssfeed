        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ROSEBURG, Ore. - K9 Zoro tracked and apprehended a man with multiple felony warrants who fled from police Thursday afternoon.
On January 25, 2024, at 12:13 pm, Officers with the Roseburg Police Department responded to a residence in the 1900 block of SE Douglas Avenue believing that 24-year-old Devin Goodman was there. Goodman, of Roseburg, had multiple warrants for his arrest and was reported to be possibly armed.
When officers arrived, they observed Goodman flee from the back of the residence and gave chase. K9 Zoro from the Douglas County Sheriff's Office responded and searched the area. K9 Zoro located Goodman hiding in heavy brush. He attempted to push K9 Zoro back and refused to comply with commands. K9 Zoro apprehended Goodman who was taken into custody by officers.
Goodman was evaluated for non-life-threatening injuries and was lodged in the Douglas County Jail.
K9 Zoro, a 6-year-old German Shepherd, has been with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office since September 2019. He was purchased by an anonymous donor in the community and gifted to the agency. The Sheriff's Office K9 program, consisting of three Patrol K9 teams and 1 narcotics K9 team, is supported financially by private donations and the Friends of Umpqua Valley Police K9 Programs, a non-profit organization whose mission is to support local police K9 teams. Bailey's Veterinary Clinic provides medical care and some food for the Sheriff's Office K9 program while Coastal Farm and Home Supply provides food while grooming is provided by K-9 Designs.]]></summary>
