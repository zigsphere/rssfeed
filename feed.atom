        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SALEM, Ore. — A rulemaking hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 22 at 10 a.m. to gather public input on administrative rules clarifying definitions related to emergency fire and emergency fire costs. Public comment can be made by joining the Zoom meeting link. See the notice of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. 
The proposed revisions clarify existing language and include recommendations made to the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) by Macias Gini & O'Connell LLP (MGO), an independent third-party contractor, that reviewed ODF’s financial practices. The proposed amended administrative rules ensure the true costs of wildland suppression costs are accurately accounted for, tracked, reported, and paid for at the statewide level.
Comments can also be sent to nancy.hirsch@odf.oregon.gov until 5 p.m. on Oct. 31. Please clarify which rule your comments pertain to in your email.
For additional information, please visit ODF’s proposed laws & rules website.]]></summary>
