        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TANGENT, Ore. – Just in time for Oregon Arbor Month, the Oregon Department  of Forestry (ODF) is announcing that the city of Tangent in Linn County has earned the Tree City USA designation. ODF administers the program for the national Arbor Day Foundation, based in Nebraska. 
Tangent joins 68 other communities in Oregon that hold the Tree City USA designation.
Brittany Oxford, ODF Urban and Community Assistance Forester, says to earn the designation, a city or town must meet four criteria:

Maintain a tree board or department
Have a community tree ordinance
Spend at least $2 per capita on urban forestry
Celebrate Arbor Day each year

In 2023, during Tangent's 50-year celebration, the Park Commission was renamed the Park & Tree Board to promote the city's efforts to maintain parks and trees. The city council unanimously approved new tree care ordinances, and the Mayor signed a proclamation recognizing Arbor Day during a celebration with food trucks and community members gathering to celebrate. 
For 2024, the City of Tangent again plans to recognize Arbor Day. City staff are looking forward to using TreePlotter Inventory software to catalog all public trees and invite the public to come out and volunteer to help. Along with plotting trees, the city is looking at planting new trees along two parks this year and encouraging residents to be aware of the importance of tree maintenance and reporting tree health concerns.
The Tree City USA program dates to 1976, when the first group of 42 cities in 16 states were named. Today, more than 3,600 communities across the country and located in every state and Puerto Rico hold the distinction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[𝐈𝐃𝐋𝐄𝐘𝐋𝐃 𝐏𝐀𝐑𝐊, 𝐎𝐫𝐞. - Search and Rescue efforts continue in the search for Rachel Merchant-Ly, a Glide Elementary kindergarten teacher whose vehicle was found crashed in the North Umpqua River.
Merchant-Ly was reported missing on Thursday, February 29th when she didn't arrive at school. A Douglas County Sheriff's deputy located signs of a motor vehicle crash near milepost 41 on Highway 138E.
On Friday, March 1, 2024, Merchant-Ly's vehicle was recovered from the North Umpqua River, but she was not found inside.
Since that time, nearly 300 hours volunteer hours of searching has taken place. Douglas County Search and Rescue has been using various methods of searching to include drone, ground and K9. The Sheriff's Office Marine Patrol has conducted water searches as well. Volunteers have searched along the riverbank from the crash site to Idleyld Park Trading Post; approximately 21 miles.
"We all want to find Mrs. Merchant-Ly and return her to her family," Sheriff John Hanlin said. "Our deputies are in constant communication with her family and providing them with updates as to our efforts. We will continue searching and using all means necessary to accomplish our mission," Hanlin added.
In addition to the efforts of DCSO and Search and Rescue volunteers, several community members have been actively looking for Merchant-Ly.
"We are aware of rafting guides and groups of rafters who have been launching all in an attempt to assist in finding her. We have also been contacting community members who are walking along the North Umpqua Trail and the highway," Hanlin said. "As always this community steps forward to care for each other."
As the weather turns more springlike, the Sheriff's Office encourages those recreating around the area to be aware Merchant-Ly is still missing and to report anything which may assist in concluding this missing person case.]]></summary>
