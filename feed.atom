        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - The Douglas County Sheriff's Office is hosting a free medication take-back Friday, June 14, 2024, at the South Umpqua Fire Department. 
The event allows residents who have unwanted or expired prescription or over-the-counter medications to turn them over to law enforcement for safe disposal. The event will be held in the parking lot of the South Umpqua Fire Department and will run from 9:00 am until 1:00 pm. 
“Safe disposal of medications is important to mitigate accidental poisonings, addiction and abuse," Lt. Brad O'Dell said. “Additionally, it can prevent environmental risks from improper disposal; such as ending up in wastewater treatment plants due to flushing them down toilets or sinks or throwing them into the garbage which ends up in landfills.”
There is no fee to participate in the take-back event and there is no need to show identification or fill out paperwork. Here is a recap of the event details: 
WHAT: DOUGLAS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE MEDICATION TAKE-BACK EVENT
WHERE: SOUTH UMPQUA FIRE DEPARTMENT (400 N. MAIN STREET, CANYONVILLE)
WHEN: FRIDAY, JUNE 14, 2024 | 9am-1pm]]></summary>
