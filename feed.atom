Law Enforcement was contacted after the citizen located what appeared to be two brand new bags of charcoal briquettes in the brush along a trail in the park.  The bags appeared to have been abandoned, and it was suspected they'd been stolen.  The bags were opened and were found to contain a large amount of suspected methamphetamine mixed in with the briquettes.  
 
This area is highly populated during the day with kids and citizens utilizing the park and trails. DINT took possession of the bags of briquettes and suspected controlled substances. DINT is seeking information from the public on anyone who may have seen the briquettes being carried into or left at the park. The specific amount of methamphetamine is not being disclosed at this time. 
 
DINT can be contacted at 541-440-4474 or through our web tip line that can be found at DCSO.COM]]></summary>
