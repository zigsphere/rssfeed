        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating May 15 as Peace Officer Memorial Day and the week in which it falls, National Police Week. 
Across the United States, ceremonies are held to remember those serving in law enforcement who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities.
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office will host a local Peace Officer Memorial Ceremony on the front lawn of the Douglas County Courthouse to pay tribute to the six law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty:
•    Officer Donald DeSues - Roseburg Police Department - EOW August 7, 1959
•    Special Deputy Ronald H. Terwilliger - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Corporal Virgle D. Knight Jr. - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Sergeant Gerald G. Chirrick - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Deputy Morris L. Taylor - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW September 14, 2002
•    Deputy S. Allen Burdic - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW March 11, 2021
The ceremony, which will be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 9:00 am, is open to members of the community who wish to pay remembrance to the fallen and their families. The tribute will include a proclamation reading by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners, a police honor guard, wreath laying ceremony, bagpipes, a 21-gun salute and a county-wide radio broadcast.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salem, Ore. — The Oregon Board of Forestry and Department of Forestry are inviting public comment on the final draft of their new shared strategic plan, the Vision for Oregon’s Forests, through May 24.
The board and department have been working together on this plan—which will replace the Forestry Program for Oregon—for the past two years. The Vision for Oregon’s Forests will provide the strategic direction that will guide both the board and department’s work for the next several years. 
Comments can be submitted online or by mail to: ODF Public Affairs, 2600 State St., Salem, OR 97310. Comments will be shared with the board prior to their June 7 vote to adopt the plan. 
Throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, the board and department will continue to build upon the foundation provided by the Vision for Oregon’s Forests through developing associated progress measures. ODF will also build out its process for development of action plans to achieve the goals identified in the Vision for Oregon’s Forests. Engagement with department and board advisory committees, Tribes, key state and federal agencies, stakeholders, other partners, and local communities to identify actions will be a core component of the planning process.]]></summary>
