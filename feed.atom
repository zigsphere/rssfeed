        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SALEM, Ore. — The Regional Forest Practice Committee for northwest Oregon will meet at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 24 at the ODF Forest Grove Office, 801 Gales Creek Road, Forest Grove, OR 97116. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

Division updates
Operator of the Year discussion and voting
Forest Practice Technical Guidance (FPTG) development and stream flow permanence update
E-Notification System (FERNS) changes
Forest resources training strategy
Compliance monitoring update

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.]]></summary>
