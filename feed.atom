        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chiloquin, Ore. – Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team 3 was mobilized last night to the Copperfield Fire in the Klamath-Lake District. The team will in brief at 1:00p.m. today and will enter unified command with the Oregon State Fire Marshal’s Red Team at 6:00 p.m. 
The Copperfield Fire, 5 miles southeast of Chiloquin, is estimated to be 2,500 acres as of this morning. 
Resources were successful overnight in laying dozer line from the heel of the fire and up the east and west flanks. Today, they will continue to work on creating dozer line along the north side of the fire to stop forward progression. Multiple air resources are on order today to help with suppression efforts. Southwest to west winds are expected to challenge the eastern fire lines throughout today. 
“Due to unfavorable weather conditions, this is a rapidly evolving incident.” Teresa Williams, Klamath-Lake District Forester said, “We’re grateful to have the help of the incident management teams in managing and working to contain this fire and protect our communities.”
According to the National Weather Service, the area is in a Red Flag Warning until 8 p.m. tonight due to strong winds with gusts up to 40 mph and low humidity. A red flag warning is issued when there are weather conditions that promote rapid spread of fire which may become life-threatening.
Klamath County Sheriff’s office has declared Level 3 (Go Now) evacuations east of Chiloquin. To check your evacuation status and for evacuation information, please visit https://www.klamathcounty.org/300/Emergency-Management.  Road closures are still in place from mile marker 5-15 on Sprague River Highway.]]></summary>

Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single-family residential structure with flames and smoke showing from the back portion of the structure. Upon arrival, firefighters found a male resident and his dog were still inside the structure.  The resident and his dog were able to exit the home on their own at the direction of the firefighters.
Fire crews entered the single-family residence and made an interior attack. Crews extinguished the fire found to be in the attic space and completed overhaul of the structure.  The single-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage. A fire investigator responded to the scene of the fire. The cause of the fire was determined to be electrical in nature.  Umpqua Valley Ambulance evaluated the resident for smoke inhalation. The resident refused treatment. Both the resident and his dog survived the fire.
Ten firefighters assisted with firefighting operations. Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Central Douglas Fire & Rescue, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power. 
The Roseburg Fire Department would like to remind everyone of the importance of working smoke alarms and ensuring you have the appropriate number of smoke alarms installed in the home. Remember to make sure you have working smoke alarms on every level of your home, outside each sleeping area and in every bedroom. Roseburg Fire Department recommends that homeowners consider a home fire sprinkler system for increased protection.]]></summary>
