        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SALEM, Ore. – The Regional Forest Practice Committee for northwest Oregon will meet at 10 a.m. on Monday, April 15 in the Tillamook Room, Building C, at the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Salem headquarters, 2600 State St., Salem, OR 97310. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

ODF updates and member training requirements
Updates and informing post-disturbance harvest rulemaking
HCP update
FERNS update
Stream model update
Planning and priority for guidance development
Forest Practice Technical Guidance comment review

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At 7:53 p.m. on April 5, 2024, Roseburg Fire Department personnel responded to a residential structure fire with a known rescue at 737 W. Wharton Street.  Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single-family residential structure with heavy fire and smoke coming from the left, front corner of the home with smoke alarms sounding. Upon arrival, a female resident informed fire crews that her husband was still inside the structure near the front of the home.
Fire crews entered the single-family residence in rescue mode. Crews were able to quickly locate the seventy-one year old male resident near the front of the home and found him to be unconscious.  Crews quickly removed the victim through the front door of the home.  The patient was transported to a nearby hospital, where the victim succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased.  Crews extinguished the fire and completed overhaul of the structure. 
The single-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage.  A fire investigator was on scene and the exact cause of the fire is under investigation. Sixteen firefighters assisted with firefighting operations.  Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Douglas County Fire District #2, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power. 
The Roseburg Fire Department would like to remind everyone of the importance of working smoke alarms and ensuring you have the appropriate number of smoke alarms installed in the home.  Remember to make sure you have working smoke alarms on every level of your home, outside each sleeping area and in every bedroom.  Roseburg Fire Department recommends that homeowners consider a home fire sprinkler system for increased protection.
