Fire crews were able to stop the spread of the fire in a timely fashion with the use of a single hose line.  Unfortunately, the contents of the house suffered significant damage.
DCFD2 and WDFD responded to this incident with 2 fire engines, 1 ambulance and 2 command units with a total of 13 personnel. Crews were unable to determine a cause of the fire. Crews were assisted by Winston PD, Avista Gas, PP&L and Umpqua Valley Ambulance.
