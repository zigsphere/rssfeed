        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At 7:53 p.m. on April 5, 2024, Roseburg Fire Department personnel responded to a residential structure fire with a known rescue at 737 W. Wharton Street.  Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single-family residential structure with heavy fire and smoke coming from the left, front corner of the home with smoke alarms sounding. Upon arrival, a female resident informed fire crews that her husband was still inside the structure near the front of the home.
Fire crews entered the single-family residence in rescue mode. Crews were able to quickly locate the seventy-one year old male resident near the front of the home and found him to be unconscious.  Crews quickly removed the victim through the front door of the home.  The patient was transported to a nearby hospital, where the victim succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased.  Crews extinguished the fire and completed overhaul of the structure. 
The single-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage.  A fire investigator was on scene and the exact cause of the fire is under investigation. Sixteen firefighters assisted with firefighting operations.  Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Douglas County Fire District #2, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power. 
The Roseburg Fire Department would like to remind everyone of the importance of working smoke alarms and ensuring you have the appropriate number of smoke alarms installed in the home.  Remember to make sure you have working smoke alarms on every level of your home, outside each sleeping area and in every bedroom.  Roseburg Fire Department recommends that homeowners consider a home fire sprinkler system for increased protection.

Assault 1
Unlawful Use of a Weapon (Felony)
Menacing
Parole Violation Warrant
No further details are being released at this time.
 
 
On April 3, 2024 at approximately 6:00 AM, the Roseburg Police Department responded to the 900 block of NE Willow Street regarding a reported stabbing. When officers arrived, they found a 50 year old Roseburg man was injured due to a stab wound and immediately began life-saving efforts. The injured male was transported to Mercy Medical Center, then later transferred out of the area for additional treatment.
 A suspect in this case, a 20 year old Roseburg man, fled the scene and has not been located despite efforts from multiple assisting agencies and a DCSO K9 track; investigators found the victim and suspect are known to each other. Roseburg Police detectives, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office detectives, DCSO deputies and Oregon State Police responded to assist and will continue to investigate the matter with assistance from the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office. At this time, there is no known ongoing threat to the general public.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ROSEBURG, Ore. - A Winston woman has been arrested on charges of animal abuse and neglect.
Douglas County Sheriff's Office Animal Control deputies began an investigation early this week after receiving a tip of a horse that was reported to be mistreated at a property in the 600-block of Longhorn Lane. During the investigation, deputies learned the horse and property owner had no connection.
Deputies discovered a 3-year-old mixed breed horse, named Ace, who was found to be severely malnourished and in neglectful conditions. Ace's owner, 24-year-old Morgan Faith Fowler of Winston, surrendered the horse to deputies on Wednesday who took it to a veterinary hospital for examination and later to Strawberry Mountain Rescue and Rehabilitation Center. Overnight, Ace's condition declined to the point that euthanasia was necessary for humane care.
Deputies contacted Fowler Thursday afternoon and took her into custody for Animal Neglect I and Animal Abuse II. She was transported to the Douglas County Jail where she was booked on those charges.
"This is a very severe case of neglect and abuse," Sheriff John Hanlin said. "The Douglas County Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation and will provide all relevant facts to the Douglas County District Attorney's Office."
Anyone who may have information regarding this case is encouraged to contact the Douglas County Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471 referencing case #24-1522.
Sheriff Hanlin expressed his thanks to Bailey Veterinary Clinic, Strawberry Mountain Rescue and Rehabilitation Center and to the deputies and volunteers who worked to save Ace and are now working on holding Fowler accountable. "These cases are never easy and I cannot thank those who have been involved enough," the Sheriff remarked.]]></summary>
