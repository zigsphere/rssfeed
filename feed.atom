        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Roseburg Fire Department will begin issuing residential burn permits, beginning on April 15, 2024 and ending on May 15, 2024.
These permits are issued for seven (7) days at a cost of $75.00.  Residential yard waste is the only material that may be burned. Prohibited items include standing berry vines, paper, wood, plastics, tires, standing grass, weeds, construction material, and material from lot clearing.  Burning may not be done on vacant lots or the property of another. Fires must be monitored by a competent adult and extinguished prior to darkness. Tools to control or extinguish the fire must be on-site whenever there is material burning.
Burn barrels are never allowed inside City limits, and anyone burning trash or burning without a permit may be subject to a fine and/or legal action.  Additionally, due diligence must be exercised while burning, even with a permit, as fire can quickly get out of control, and the person responsible for the fire may be subject to fines, legal action, or restitution.
If possible, residents are urged to utilize alternatives to burning, such as composting, chipping, mulching, or transporting the debris to the Douglas County Landfill.  More information on these options can be found at https://douglascounty-oregon.us/449/Wood-Yard-Waste
To request a burning permit in the City of Roseburg, call (541) 492-6770 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. This information, as well as the burn permit request form is also available on the city website at https://www.cityofroseburg.org/departments/fire]]></summary>
