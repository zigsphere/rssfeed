        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[𝐃𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐋𝐀𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐓𝐘, 𝐎𝐫𝐞. - Since 2019, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office - 911 Communications Division has had the ability to receive Text-to-911.
Text-to-911 is an important service. It is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak due to an emergency, such as a home invasion or abusive partner. Additionally, individuals that are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may benefit from this technology.
A few things you should know about how Text-to-911 works:
• Texting to 911 is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak in an emergency. The key thing to remember is “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.
• When texting to 911 for an emergency the first message should be the location of the emergency (including city) and the type of emergency help needed (police, fire, or medical).
• Keep text messages brief and concise; using full words.
• Stay with your phone, be prepared to answer questions and follow instructions from the 911 dispatcher.
• Photos and videos should not be sent to 911 because not all wireless carriers are able to support this feature and it can delay dispatchers in sending help to you.
• You cannot include 911 in a group text or while roaming.
Some jurisdictions are unable to accept Text-to-911. If you send a text to 911 from a wireless carrier or a city/county without Text-to-911 service, you should receive a message saying that there is no text service to 911 available at this time.
Please remember, “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.]]></summary>

Public hearings scheduled for wildfire prevention and certified burn manager proposed rules
SALEM, Ore. — Public hearings are scheduled July 30 to gather feedback on administrative rules packages expanding and updating wildfire prevention restrictions, the Certified Burn Manager Program, and establishing the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program.
The Board of Forestry approved the public hearing process for the proposed rule packages during their June 5 meeting: 

629-025-0040 to 629-025-0050
629-042-1005 to 629-042-1065
629-042-2000 to 629-042-2060
629-043-0020 to 629-043-0030
629-047-0010 to 629-047-0100

See the agency’s rules website to access notices of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. The department consulted a Rulemaking Advisory Committee representing a wide variety of stakeholder interests while drafting the proposed rules. 
The prevention rules align fire prevention, equipment requirements for fire suppression and use of fireworks on public lands to increase wildfire prevention efforts. Certified Burn Manager proposed rules intend to advance the maturity of the Certified Burn Manager Program. Proposed rules also establish the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program described in Senate Bill 80 (2023) and HB 4016 (2024).

July 30, 10 a.m., Zoom meeting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dufur, Ore. – Throughout the evening winds subsided and the Larch Creek Fire growth slowed. Dozers working through the night made good progress putting in control line and engines patrolled near homes in the fire area.  
Today structure task forces will continue to mop up and secure around homes in the fire area. Firefighters will be putting in hose lays and working with engines and water tenders to strengthen control lines. Dozers and crews will work on establishing line around the fire footprint on the east side of Highway 197. Air resources continue to be available and will engage as needed throughout the day.  
The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Incident Management Team 2 will shadow the Central Oregon IMT today. This evening at 6 p.m. ODF Team 2 and OSFM Green Team will officially transition into unified command. A huge Thank You to the Central Oregon Type 3 Interagency IMT for their coordination and efforts on this quickly emerging incident. 
The weather will moderate today with temperatures in the low 90’s with afternoon winds that should moderate into the evening. The next few days should see temperatures continuing to decrease and less substantial winds in the fire area, a very welcome forecast for firefighters. Yesterday there was one firefighter with heat related injuries who was transported to a local hospital.
