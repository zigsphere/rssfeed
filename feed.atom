        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating May 15 as Peace Officer Memorial Day and the week in which it falls, National Police Week. 
Across the United States, ceremonies are held to remember those serving in law enforcement who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities.
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office will host a local Peace Officer Memorial Ceremony on the front lawn of the Douglas County Courthouse to pay tribute to the six law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty:
•    Officer Donald DeSues - Roseburg Police Department - EOW August 7, 1959
•    Special Deputy Ronald H. Terwilliger - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Corporal Virgle D. Knight Jr. - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Sergeant Gerald G. Chirrick - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW July 23, 1985
•    Deputy Morris L. Taylor - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW September 14, 2002
•    Deputy S. Allen Burdic - Douglas County Sheriff's Office - EOW March 11, 2021
The ceremony, which will be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 9:00 am, is open to members of the community who wish to pay remembrance to the fallen and their families. The tribute will include a proclamation reading by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners, a police honor guard, wreath laying ceremony, bagpipes, a 21-gun salute and a county-wide radio broadcast.]]></summary>
