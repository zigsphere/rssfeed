        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dalles, Ore. – Moderate fire behavior allowed for further progress on the Microwave Tower Fire today as crews worked to secure more of the fire’s east end with hand line, dozer line, and water drops from helicopters and other air resources. The fire continued to back down on a north facing ridge along I-84 just west of Mosier and will likely do so through tomorrow. Smoke can be observed along the highway.
More accurate mapping has sized the fire at 704 acres. Tonight, crews will work towards hooking in line with hand crews and dozers along the eastern and southern edges of the fire footprint while structural firefighters will continue to assess and further secure homes.
Tomorrow, the Type 1 Great Basin Team 6 will assume command at 6 a.m. The incident command post will be at the Hood River High School. Public information officers with the team will receive inquiries about both the nearby Whiskey Creek and Microwave Tower fires. 
Evacuation levels remain in place. There is an estimate of 100 homes that are under Level 3 evacuations and 500 residences threatened in the Mosier area. The gymnasium at the Hood River Middle School is a designated Red Cross Shelter for those evacuated.
LEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.
LEVEL 2 - GET SET from the City of Mosier and Huskey Rd., south to Wilson Rd., and east to Mosier Creek Rd.
LEVEL 1 - GET READY from Mosier Creek Rd., east to Dry Creek Rd., north to the City of Mosier border and south to Osborn Cutoff Rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THE DALLES, Ore. – Crews worked through the night on the Microwave Tower fire near Mosier, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures and higher humidity. Much of the progress was along the southern portion of the fire, while the northern portion continues to present challenges due to limited access and steep slopes. Air resources played a critical role in helping slow the fire’s spread in difficult terrain.
The fire is currently being mapped, but early indications show that it is roughly 591 acres. Currently, the fire is backing down north facing slopes just west of Mosier, and smoke is visible from I-84.
Today, winds are predicted to be calmer than yesterday, allowing firefighters a good opportunity to continue the progress from last night. The Type 1 Great Basin National Team currently managing the Whiskey Creek Fire in Hood River County will assume command from Oregon Department of Forestry Central Oregon District tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. The incident command post will be at the Hood River High School.
Evacuation levels have not changed since the last Wasco County Sheriff’s update at 10 p.m. yesterday. The gymnasium at the Hood River Middle School is a designated Red Cross Shelter for those evacuating.
LEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.
LEVEL 2 - GET SET from the City of Mosier and Huskey Rd., south to Wilson Rd., and east to Mosier Creek Rd.
LEVEL 1 - GET READY from Mosier Creek Rd., east to Dry Creek Rd., north to the City of Mosier border and south to Osborn Cutoff Rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THE DALLES, Ore. – Residents west of the Columbia Gorge town of Mosier are being told to evacuate as the fast-moving Microwave Tower Fire burns eastward, driven by strong westerly winds of 30 to 35 miles per hour. 
LEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.
LEVEL 2 - GET SET to evacuate from the city of Mosier and from Huskey Rd. east to Mosier Creek Rd., and south to Jasper Lane.
A Red Cross shelter for evacuees has been set up at the Hood River Middle School, 1602 May Street, Hood River, OR 97031
Firefighters from ODF’s Unit Office in The Dalles are being aided by Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area U.S. Forest Service and local fire departments in battling the blaze that started west of Rattler Ridge just west of Mosier in the Columbia Gorge. A very large airtanker has been ordered to help on the fire, which was reported at 4 p.m. this afternoon. A task force of fire engines and a dozer from the Larch Creek Fire in south Wasco County are being diverted to assist on the fire. The I-84 freeway currently remains open. 
The fire is burning in grass and timber, pushed eastwards by strong westerly winds of 30 to 35 miles per hour. Earlier this afternoon it was estimated at 100 to 150 acres. Cause is not known at this time. 
Evacuation levels may change quickly given the spread rate of the fire, with new areas being moved into evacuation status. For the most up-to-date evacuation information, please visit the Wasco County Sheriff’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/WascoCountySheriff/
