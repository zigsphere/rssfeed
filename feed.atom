The Fire Department realizes that hydrant flushing may cause some inconvenience; however, the flushing program is necessary to ensure the proper functioning and delivery of adequate water from the water mains when needed for fire control.  The community’s cooperation with this hydrant-flushing program is appreciated. 
During the flushing process, customers may experience low water pressure or discolored water. While the water is safe to drink, customers may prefer to wait until it runs clear before drinking or washing clothes and dishes.]]></summary>

Harvard Avenue. Firefighters arrived on scene to find heavy fire coming from the second and third floors of a large residential structure that included multiple apartments.  Upon arrival, residents informed fire crews there may be a thirteen-year-old resident still inside the structure. 
Multiple crews entered the multi-family residence and searched all floors for the missing person.  Crews were able to locate the young boy on the second floor and found him to be unconscious.  Crews quickly removed the victim through a second-floor window.  The patient was transported to a nearby hospital, where the victim was pronounced deceased.  Two other patients were transported to a nearby hospital for smoke inhalation.  Crews extinguished the fire and spent considerable time overhauling the structure. There were multiple dogs found deceased due to the fire.  The American Red Cross responded and was on scene assisting multiple displaced residents. 
The multi-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage.  The fire investigation is ongoing and multiple agencies are involved in the efforts.  Thirty-one firefighters assisted with firefighting efforts. Other agencies assisting with the fire included Douglas County Fire District #2, Winston-Dillard Fire District, Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Pacific Power, Avista Utilities, Roseburg Police Department, American Red Cross, and Adapt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SALEM, Ore. – The Regional Forest Practice Committee for southwest Oregon will meet at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, March 19 at the Douglas Forest Protective Association, located at 1758 NE Airport Rd. in Roseburg. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

ODF updates and member training requirements
Updates and informing post-disturbance harvest rulemaking
HCP update
Planning and priority for guidance development
Forest Practice Technical Guidance comment review

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.]]></summary>
