At about 1:35 pm, deputies from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office responded to the area of the RV park, 333 Ruckles Drive, after receiving information about a physical disturbance and shooting.
Responders located a male suffering from multiple gunshot wounds just south of the park on Booth Ranch Road. He was later identified as Damion Sumner, 29, of Dillard. Deputies and a Myrtle Creek Police Officer provided Sumner aid, but he succumbed to his wounds and was declared deceased on scene.
Daniel Hetrick, 22, of Myrtle Creek was taken into custody nearby without incident. Hetrick has been charged with second-degree murder and unlawful use of a weapon and lodged at the Douglas County Jail.
The Douglas County Major Crimes Team was activated and continues to investigate. The team consists of detectives from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Roseburg Police Department, Oregon State Police, and members of the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ELKTON, Ore. - The Oregon Tree Farm System honored family forest landowners for the exceptional management of their forests at its annual meeting in November. Top honors went to Douglas County’s Kesterson family as Oregon’s Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year for 2025.
Receiving a Silver Award at the Oregon Tree Farm’s Annual Meeting were Tom and Julia Tibbs of Washington County for their multi-resource management of their 300 forested acres near Buxton.
Others being recognized for exemplary management of their family forests included:

Rich Clark from Benton County
John and Alesanne Dugan from Lane County
Steve and Katie Kohl from Linn County, and 
Neil Schroeder and Laurie and Jim Marsh from Yamhill County 

The Kesterson family’s 2,200-acre property near Elkton in Douglas County has been in the family since 1905. Currently under the leadership of fifth-generation owner Gary Williamson, the property is managed for wood, recreation, wildlife and water quality.
The property has approximately nine miles of river frontage along the Umpqua River. Their Big K Guest Ranch offers fishing, rafting, and accommodations for family and corporate gatherings.
The family manages 1,500 acres of forest for timber and wildlife habitat, and approximately 700 acres of pasture and hay fields for a herd of 90 cows.
Wildlife habitat and water quality are a focus on both the forested and streamside areas.
With much to be proud of managing the property, Gary Williamson states that he is most proud, blessed, and honored to be a part of a family that has been caring for the property for five generations, with his children being part of the sixth.
Oregon joined the Tree Farm System in 1941 and has recognized and honored family forest landowners as Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year every year since 1966, except in 2021 the first year of the COVID pandemic.

The first arriving engine reported a fully involved travel trailer with multiple nearby structures. 
 
Thanks to the efficient response of our firefighters, the fire was stopped from spreading and contained to the travel trailer. The travel trailer suffered significant damage and is considered a total loss.  No injuries were reported by the resident or the firefighters working at the scene.
 
CDF&R responded to this incident with two fire engines, one truck and one command unit, totaling 9 personnel. Due to the heavy fire damage, crews could not determine the cause of the fire.
