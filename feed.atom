        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What: The Oregon Department of Forestry’s (ODF) Aviation Unit and Northwest Oregon Area are inviting media to their annual Fire Boss training, which will include demonstrations by our Amphibious Single Engine Airtankers. 
Background: On July 2, the Aviation Unit and Northwest Oregon Area will be conducting an introduction to the Fire Bosses with a training component in the field.  This training gives our boots on the ground the opportunity to meet the pilots, become familiar with the Amphibious Single Engine Airtankers, see what the capabilities are, and get practical experience in air-to-ground communications.  
The orientation portion of the training will be conducted at Hillsboro Airport and then the aircraft will depart for Henry Hagg Lake in Washington County. Hagg Lake has been used in the past as a water source for helicopters, as well as the Fire Bosses.  
Details and Visuals:The Fire Bosses will arrive and land at Hillsboro airport and provide the introduction to the aircraft and conduct a question-and-answer session with firefighters. 
After, the aircraft will takeoff from Hillsboro and fly to Henry Hagg Lake where the ground units will then travel to. When the lake is cleared of boaters, with the help of Washington County Parks personnel, the Fire Bosses will scoop and fly to the field location where the hands-on portion of the day will be held.  
There will be several opportunities for interviews throughout the day with trainees and instructors. 
When: Tuesday, July 2, 2022
Starting Location: Hillsboro Airport Aviation FBO, 3845 NE 30th, Hillsboro, OR, 97124
Secondary Location: Henry Haggs Lake, Parking Land, Gaston, OR 97119
Time: 10:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. at Hillsboro Airport
           1:00 p.m.- 3:00 p.m. at Henry Haggs Lake
RSVPs are requested, but not required. Please RSVP by emailing Jessica Neujahr, jessica.neujahr@odf.oregon.gov.]]></summary>
