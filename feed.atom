        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AZALEA, Ore. - On March 2, 2024, shortly after midnight, Douglas County 9-1-1 received a text-to-911 from an individual stating he had gotten stuck in snow after following his GPS and was in need of assistance.
Deputies learned 34-year-old Juan Carlos Torres-Esquivel of Santa Rosa, California had purchased a 1996 Ford F150 in Corvallis and was enroute to his residence in Santa Rosa when he encountered weather related delays on I-5. Google maps recommended a detour which he selected that instructed him to take exit 88, drive east on Upper Cow Creek for approximately 13 miles, and turn south onto Snow Creek Rd.
Torres-Esquivel made it approximately 5 miles up Snow Creek Road before sliding the passenger side of the vehicle into a deep ditch and getting the vehicle stuck in approximately 24" of snow. He was unprepared for the conditions and was unsuccessful in attempting to dig the vehicle out without a shovel.
Douglas County Search and Rescue was activated and responded to assist. SAR responded and was unable to make it to his location with the Snowcat due to a U-Haul truck being abandoned approximately 2 or 3 miles up Snow Creek Rd in the middle of the roadway. Members of the 4x4 team were able to maneuver around the U-Haul after airing down their tires and retrieved Torres-Esquivel.
Deputies provided Torres-Esquivel a courtesy ride to Seven Feathers.
The Sheriff's Office would like to remind drivers of the dangers of blindly following GPS devices.
"GPS devices are often set to direct drivers through the fastest route to their destination. Oftentimes, this means direction through non-maintained road systems, including forest roads," Lt. Brad O'Dell said. "Blindly following GPS navigation can potentially lead to dangerous situations and have serious consequences. Although travel delays can be disruptive, it is best to remain on routes that are maintained."]]></summary>
