        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At 4:08 on Tuesday afternoon, crews from Central Douglas Fire & Rescue were dispatched to a reported structure fire on Sunburst Court off of Ryland Drive in the Green District.  Initial reports indicated that the garage was on fire and the house was filling with smoke.
Thanks to the efficient response of our firefighters, the fire was contained to the garage and did not extend to the living quarters of the residence. Although the garage suffered significant damage, the most important thing to note is that the occupants and their pets were able to get out of the structure safely.  No injuries were reported by the residents or the firefighters working the scene.
CDF&R responded to this incident with three fire engines and two command units, totaling 12 personnel.  Due to the heavy fire damage, crews could not determine the cause of the fire.  PP&L assisted crews at the scene.  The Red Cross was notified and assisted the occupants of the home.
