        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Roseburg Fire Department will begin issuing residential burn permits, beginning on April 15, 2024 and ending on May 15, 2024.
These permits are issued for seven (7) days at a cost of $75.00.  Residential yard waste is the only material that may be burned. Prohibited items include standing berry vines, paper, wood, plastics, tires, standing grass, weeds, construction material, and material from lot clearing.  Burning may not be done on vacant lots or the property of another. Fires must be monitored by a competent adult and extinguished prior to darkness. Tools to control or extinguish the fire must be on-site whenever there is material burning.
Burn barrels are never allowed inside City limits, and anyone burning trash or burning without a permit may be subject to a fine and/or legal action.  Additionally, due diligence must be exercised while burning, even with a permit, as fire can quickly get out of control, and the person responsible for the fire may be subject to fines, legal action, or restitution.
If possible, residents are urged to utilize alternatives to burning, such as composting, chipping, mulching, or transporting the debris to the Douglas County Landfill.  More information on these options can be found at https://douglascounty-oregon.us/449/Wood-Yard-Waste
To request a burning permit in the City of Roseburg, call (541) 492-6770 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. This information, as well as the burn permit request form is also available on the city website at https://www.cityofroseburg.org/departments/fire]]></summary>

Using funding from the Oregon State Legislature, and the USDA Forest Service through the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), ODF has been able to hire a grants administrator and four new community assistance foresters – up from just one for the whole state.
Scott Altenhoff, Manager of ODF’s Urban and Community Assistance Forestry program, said he’s looking forward to how much more the added staff will allow the agency to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EUGENE, Ore. – Oregon Community Trees (OCT) is inviting students and organizations to submit abstracts on case studies or research to present as a poster presentation at this year’s Oregon Urban Forestry conference. The conference is being held on Thursday, June 27 in Eugene at Venue 252. This year’s theme is “More Housing, More Trees: Giving Oregonians Both.”
OCT is organizing the conference, which is co-sponsored by the Oregon Dept. of Forestry and the USDA Forest Service. Presentations can be about successes in preserving large, healthy shade trees or room to plant them on residential or commercial properties that were developed or redeveloped with an increased density level. Also sought are presentations about methods of tree preservation during construction, ideas for redesigning streets and right-of-way planting strips to make room for larger trees, and similar concepts.
Posters are limited to 30” x 40”. All selected posters will be displayed at the conference. To be considered for selection you must be able to attend the conference and be on hand to answer questions from people visiting the poster display area during breaks, the lunch hour, and the social hour following the conference. Discount tickets for students are available for $80 (includes lunch). Some scholarships are available for those who can submit a statement of financial need.
Submissions should be sent via 2024 UCF Conference Poster Application Form no later than Friday, May 17th by 5:00 p.m. 
Please reach out to Samantha Wolf at sammwolf@gmail.com for any questions or concerns. 
Posters can be set up the day before the conference on Wednesday, June 26 from noon to 4:30 p.m. All poster presenters are expected to register for the conference. Poster presenters can go online at oregoncommunitytrees.org to register and get information about the Conference and the Poster Presentations.
