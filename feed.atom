The reporting party had noted the roof of the residential structure was on fire and all occupants were out of the home.  
Firefighters arrived on scene to find a two story residential structure with heavy smoke showing from both the roof vents and the vents in the gable ends. Firefighters found an active fire inside the attic of the two story structure. Firefighters completed a primary and secondary search of the home, extinguished the fire, and completed overhaul. Stop loss measures were taken to cover holes in the roof from impending weather.
A fire investigator was on scene. The cause of the fire was determined to be electrical in nature. The structure sustained structural, smoke, and water damage.
Fourteen firefighters assisted with firefighting operations.  Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May of 2022, Jerry Lee Thacker, now a 57-year-old Roseburg man, was arrested on charges of Rape, Sodomy, Unlawful Sexual Penetration and Sexual Abuse. The alleged victim was a 13-year-old juvenile female and Roseburg resident. On January 9, 2024, Thacker failed to appear for trial resulting in a warrant for his arrest. The Roseburg Police Department began an investigation into Thacker’s whereabouts at that time. Using intelligence gathered during that effort, investigators came to believe Thacker fled to Knoxville, Tennessee and was living with a family member. Our agency reached out to the U.S. Marshals Service in Oregon and requested assistance in apprehending Thacker. The U.S. Marshals Service agreed to take the case and within a short period of time, located Thacker and served the warrant by taking Thacker into custody in the Knoxville, Tennessee area. Thacker was lodged at the Knox County Jail in Tennessee pending extradition. The Roseburg Police Department is very appreciative for the assistance of The U.S. Marshals Service in this case.]]></summary>
