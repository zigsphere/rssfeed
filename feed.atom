        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dufur, Ore. – Throughout the evening winds subsided and the Larch Creek Fire growth slowed. Dozers working through the night made good progress putting in control line and engines patrolled near homes in the fire area.  
Today structure task forces will continue to mop up and secure around homes in the fire area. Firefighters will be putting in hose lays and working with engines and water tenders to strengthen control lines. Dozers and crews will work on establishing line around the fire footprint on the east side of Highway 197. Air resources continue to be available and will engage as needed throughout the day.  
The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Incident Management Team 2 will shadow the Central Oregon IMT today. This evening at 6 p.m. ODF Team 2 and OSFM Green Team will officially transition into unified command. A huge Thank You to the Central Oregon Type 3 Interagency IMT for their coordination and efforts on this quickly emerging incident. 
The weather will moderate today with temperatures in the low 90’s with afternoon winds that should moderate into the evening. The next few days should see temperatures continuing to decrease and less substantial winds in the fire area, a very welcome forecast for firefighters. Yesterday there was one firefighter with heat related injuries who was transported to a local hospital.

The award recognizes Oxendine’s exceptional contributions to urban and community forestry, including his work as president of the non-profit OCT in 2022-23. 
This accolade follows closely on the heels of his earlier recognition in April, when he received the Oregon Heritage Tree Program’s 2024 “Tree Hero Award” during Oregon’s Arbor Month celebrations. Both awards are in addition to his work with the City of Talent to restore tree canopy after the Almeda Fire, which led to the City’s being named by the Oregon Dept. of Forestry as Oregon Tree City of the Year in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dufur, Ore. – With a Red Flag warning across the fire area yesterday the high winds, high temperatures and low relative humidity moved the Larch Creek Fire across Highway 197 and continued its fast-moving growth to the east Wednesday evening. The Wasco County Sheriffs Office and the Incident Commanders of the Unified Command, Central Oregon Type 3 Interagency Incident Management Team and Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Green Team worked together to quickly elevate the evacuation levels. 
The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) Team 2 has been ordered and will be arriving this morning. They will be in unified command with OSFM Green Team starting tomorrow evening.
Air resources, structure task forces, dozers, engines and handcrews worked tirelessly throughout the day.  Resources will remain engaged throughout the night, protecting structures and building fireline. 
Stay informed on updated evacuation alerts here:

A Red Cross shelter is open at Maupin High School for all community members effected by the current evacuations.
 Sherman County Fairgrounds is open for evacuation of livestock and pets. Hood River Fairgrounds is also open to displaced animals. Hwy 197 is being closely monitored and may be closed or have traffic control, check Trip Check for updates. Road & Weather Conditions Map | TripCheck - Oregon Traveler Information
Local fire danger levels are “extreme”, everyone is strongly encouraged to realize the current danger of how quickly a fire can start; it only takes one spark. Please do your part, do not park or drive on dry grass, know the current fire restrictions and prepare yourself with a shovel, water and fire extinguisher when outdoors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dalles, Ore. – Firefighters from the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District, U.S. Forest Service, local fire districts and landowners have quickly responded to a wildfire near Friend, OR. Firefighters are under initial attack and will continue operations into the night. The fire is currently burning with moderate-to-high spread, estimated at 3,500 acres in grass and timber fuel types. Containment is at 0%. 
The Larch Creek Fire is located 5 miles southwest of Dufur, OR near Friend, OR. It is burning southeast of Winslow Road in Township 2S Range 13E, which is west of Highway 97.
Last reported resources: 8 engines, 20-person hand crew from USFS Mt Hood, 4 dozers, local landowner resources, and multiple air resources. A Type 3 Central Oregon Fire Management Service team has been ordered and is in route. 
With high temperatures, low humidity, and difficult terrain, suppression efforts are requiring diverse methods of attack, prioritizing safety while protecting life and structures. Increased winds are playing a significant factor in fire behavior. No structures have been reported lost.
Evacuations: Level 3 - GO NOW - Evacuate from Clark Miller Road east to Hix Rd, North to Kingley-Friend Market Rd., South to Badger Creek Rd.
Level 2 - BE SET to evacuate from the following areas: Mc Corkle Rd south to Happy Ridge Rd, East to J Hix Rd, West to FS Rd 2700.
Level 1 - BE READY in Tygh Valley, Pine Hollow, and Wamic.
The Wasco County Fairgrounds is a temporarily designated evacuation point for livestock. A Red Cross Evacuation Shelter is opening at Maupin High School.

The fire started sometime around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9, 2024. The cause is under investigation.]]></summary>
