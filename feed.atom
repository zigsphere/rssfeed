        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salem, Ore—The Oregon Department of Forestry’s Regional Forest Practices Committees (RFPCs) are looking for new members.  The RFPCs play a key role in advising the Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches.
“Ideal candidates are forest landowners or have experience in forest operations, care deeply about our forests, and have a desire to work together to ensure forests serve the needs of all Oregonians,” said Don Everingham, ODF’s Northwest Area Director and non-voting coordinator of the RFPCs.
There are three regional committees: Eastern, Southwest and Northwest.  There are vacancies on all three committees.  The committees meet typically three times a year, but the frequency is determined by the committee chairpersons.  Although meeting in person is preferred there is also typically a virtual option for attendance.  These are volunteer positions with no compensation other than travel expenses.
The committees are looking for diverse viewpoints and candidates from communities that are not often represented.
“If you have an interest, then I encourage you to apply,” said Everingham.  “Other than the requirement to have a majority of members be forest landowners, the committees have flexibility to pick and confirm new members.”
For more information contact your local district forester, see the RFPCs webpage, or for written background information and an application packet email: emily.l.gregorio@odf.oregon.gov
The deadline for committee applications is July 31.]]></summary>
