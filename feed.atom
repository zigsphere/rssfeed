        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dalles, Ore. – Firefighters from the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District, U.S. Forest Service, local fire districts and landowners have quickly responded to a wildfire near Friend, OR. Firefighters are under initial attack and will continue operations into the night. The fire is currently burning with moderate-to-high spread, estimated at 3,500 acres in grass and timber fuel types. Containment is at 0%. 
The Larch Creek Fire is located 5 miles southwest of Dufur, OR near Friend, OR. It is burning southeast of Winslow Road in Township 2S Range 13E, which is west of Highway 97.
Last reported resources: 8 engines, 20-person hand crew from USFS Mt Hood, 4 dozers, local landowner resources, and multiple air resources. A Type 3 Central Oregon Fire Management Service team has been ordered and is in route. 
With high temperatures, low humidity, and difficult terrain, suppression efforts are requiring diverse methods of attack, prioritizing safety while protecting life and structures. Increased winds are playing a significant factor in fire behavior. No structures have been reported lost.
Evacuations: Level 3 - GO NOW - Evacuate from Clark Miller Road east to Hix Rd, North to Kingley-Friend Market Rd., South to Badger Creek Rd.
Level 2 - BE SET to evacuate from the following areas: Mc Corkle Rd south to Happy Ridge Rd, East to J Hix Rd, West to FS Rd 2700.
Level 1 - BE READY in Tygh Valley, Pine Hollow, and Wamic.
The Wasco County Fairgrounds is a temporarily designated evacuation point for livestock. A Red Cross Evacuation Shelter is opening at Maupin High School.
https://www.facebook.com/WascoCountySheriff or the Wasco County Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/wascocounty/ 
The fire started sometime around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9, 2024. The cause is under investigation.]]></summary>
