“July and August see the most visitors to our state forests,” said Joe Offer, Oregon Department of Forestry’s Recreation Program Manager. “With that increase of visitors is also an increase in wildfire danger since 70 percent of wildfires are human caused.”
ODF posts fire danger levels and public use restrictions on information boards in recreation areas and on most access roads to state forests. There are four levels: Low, Moderate, High and Extreme, with corresponding restrictions for certain activities. As the forests dry out and the humidity levels decrease, the fire danger levels typically increase—and so do the restrictions to help prevent fires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - In coordination with fire managers, the Sheriff's Office has downgraded a previous evacuation Level 2 - SET at Diamond Lake to a Level 1 - BE READY evacuation notice. 
The area being downgraded to a LEVEL 1 - BE READY includes the following: 

Diamond Lake Horse Corrals
Diamond Lake Campground (east side of the lake) - ALL 238 sites, all loops A-M.
Diamond Lake RV Park - All 110 sites.

The downgrade is effective on July 26, 2024 at 3:15 pm.
A LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.
Although the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that there is a significant forest closure which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff's Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service.
