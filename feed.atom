        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salem, Ore.—The heat of summer makes shade-covered state forest an appealing destination for many.
“July and August see the most visitors to our state forests,” said Joe Offer, Oregon Department of Forestry’s Recreation Program Manager. “With that increase of visitors is also an increase in wildfire danger since 70 percent of wildfires are human caused.”
ODF posts fire danger levels and public use restrictions on information boards in recreation areas and on most access roads to state forests. There are four levels: Low, Moderate, High and Extreme, with corresponding restrictions for certain activities. As the forests dry out and the humidity levels decrease, the fire danger levels typically increase—and so do the restrictions to help prevent fires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - In coordination with fire managers, the Sheriff's Office has downgraded a previous evacuation Level 2 - SET at Diamond Lake to a Level 1 - BE READY evacuation notice. 
The area being downgraded to a LEVEL 1 - BE READY includes the following: 

Diamond Lake Horse Corrals
Diamond Lake Campground (east side of the lake) - ALL 238 sites, all loops A-M.
Diamond Lake RV Park - All 110 sites.

The downgrade is effective on July 26, 2024 at 3:15 pm.
A LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.
Although the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that there is a significant forest closure which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff's Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service. 
An interactive evacuation map can be found on our website at https://www.dcso.com/evacuations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THE DALLES, Ore. – The Great Basin Complex Incident Management Team 6, led by Incident Commander Mack McFarland, assumed command of the Microwave Tower Fire at 6:00 a.m. this morning, Wednesday, July 24, 2024. The Complex Incident Management Team brings additional resources and management capabilities to implement a full suppression strategy for the Microwave Tower Fire. 
The fire has seen moderate activity with intermittent single tree torching, some flanking and smoldering creating a moderate amount of smoke. The fire also saw growth backing down the north slope. With the expected increased winds today, crews are ready to address increased fire behavior. There is a potential for increased smoke in the area.
More accurate mapping has sized the fire at 704 acres and 0% containment. The fire is located 5 miles west, southwest of Mosier, OR. Currently there are approximately 72 personnel assigned to the fire. They are building a combination of dozer and hand line on the southern edge to contain the fire. Additionally, crews are working to improve roads, trails and previously constructed contingency lines around the remainder of the fire.
The Microwave Tower Fire was first detected on July 22, 2024 and the cause is currently under investigation.
Evacuations
The Mosier Senior Center at 500 E. 2nd Ave., is being used as a cooling center for the public where they can also charge their devices. For up-to-date information on evacuations in the area, please visit https://www.facebook.com/WascoCountySheriff.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dalles, Ore. – Moderate fire behavior allowed for further progress on the Microwave Tower Fire today as crews worked to secure more of the fire’s east end with hand line, dozer line, and water drops from helicopters and other air resources. The fire continued to back down on a north facing ridge along I-84 just west of Mosier and will likely do so through tomorrow. Smoke can be observed along the highway.
More accurate mapping has sized the fire at 704 acres. Tonight, crews will work towards hooking in line with hand crews and dozers along the eastern and southern edges of the fire footprint while structural firefighters will continue to assess and further secure homes.
Tomorrow, the Type 1 Great Basin Team 6 will assume command at 6 a.m. The incident command post will be at the Hood River High School. Public information officers with the team will receive inquiries about both the nearby Whiskey Creek and Microwave Tower fires. 
Evacuation levels remain in place. There is an estimate of 100 homes that are under Level 3 evacuations and 500 residences threatened in the Mosier area. The gymnasium at the Hood River Middle School is a designated Red Cross Shelter for those evacuated.
LEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.
LEVEL 2 - GET SET from the City of Mosier and Huskey Rd., south to Wilson Rd., and east to Mosier Creek Rd.
LEVEL 1 - GET READY from Mosier Creek Rd., east to Dry Creek Rd., north to the City of Mosier border and south to Osborn Cutoff Rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THE DALLES, Ore. – Crews worked through the night on the Microwave Tower fire near Mosier, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures and higher humidity. Much of the progress was along the southern portion of the fire, while the northern portion continues to present challenges due to limited access and steep slopes. Air resources played a critical role in helping slow the fire’s spread in difficult terrain.
The fire is currently being mapped, but early indications show that it is roughly 591 acres. Currently, the fire is backing down north facing slopes just west of Mosier, and smoke is visible from I-84.
Today, winds are predicted to be calmer than yesterday, allowing firefighters a good opportunity to continue the progress from last night. The Type 1 Great Basin National Team currently managing the Whiskey Creek Fire in Hood River County will assume command from Oregon Department of Forestry Central Oregon District tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. The incident command post will be at the Hood River High School.
Evacuation levels have not changed since the last Wasco County Sheriff’s update at 10 p.m. yesterday. The gymnasium at the Hood River Middle School is a designated Red Cross Shelter for those evacuating.
LEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.
LEVEL 2 - GET SET from the City of Mosier and Huskey Rd., south to Wilson Rd., and east to Mosier Creek Rd.
