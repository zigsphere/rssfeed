        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salem, Ore—The Oregon Department of Forestry’s Regional Forest Practices Committees (RFPCs) are looking for new members.  The RFPCs play a key role in advising the Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches.
“Ideal candidates are forest landowners or have experience in forest operations, care deeply about our forests, and have a desire to work together to ensure forests serve the needs of all Oregonians,” said Don Everingham, ODF’s Northwest Area Director and non-voting coordinator of the RFPCs.
There are three regional committees: Eastern, Southwest and Northwest.  There are vacancies on all three committees.  The committees meet typically three times a year, but the frequency is determined by the committee chairpersons.  Although meeting in person is preferred there is also typically a virtual option for attendance.  These are volunteer positions with no compensation other than travel expenses.
The committees are looking for diverse viewpoints and candidates from communities that are not often represented.
“If you have an interest, then I encourage you to apply,” said Everingham.  “Other than the requirement to have a majority of members be forest landowners, the committees have flexibility to pick and confirm new members.”
For more information contact your local district forester, see the RFPCs webpage, or for written background information and an application packet email: emily.l.gregorio@odf.oregon.gov
The deadline for committee applications is July 31.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[𝐃𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐋𝐀𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐓𝐘, 𝐎𝐫𝐞. - Since 2019, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office - 911 Communications Division has had the ability to receive Text-to-911.
Text-to-911 is an important service. It is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak due to an emergency, such as a home invasion or abusive partner. Additionally, individuals that are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may benefit from this technology.
A few things you should know about how Text-to-911 works:
• Texting to 911 is intended to benefit people that may not be able to speak in an emergency. The key thing to remember is “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.
• When texting to 911 for an emergency the first message should be the location of the emergency (including city) and the type of emergency help needed (police, fire, or medical).
• Keep text messages brief and concise; using full words.
• Stay with your phone, be prepared to answer questions and follow instructions from the 911 dispatcher.
• Photos and videos should not be sent to 911 because not all wireless carriers are able to support this feature and it can delay dispatchers in sending help to you.
• You cannot include 911 in a group text or while roaming.
Some jurisdictions are unable to accept Text-to-911. If you send a text to 911 from a wireless carrier or a city/county without Text-to-911 service, you should receive a message saying that there is no text service to 911 available at this time.
Please remember, “𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏, 𝑻𝒆𝒙𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝑪𝒂𝒏’𝒕”.]]></summary>

Public hearings scheduled for wildfire prevention and certified burn manager proposed rules
SALEM, Ore. — Public hearings are scheduled July 30 to gather feedback on administrative rules packages expanding and updating wildfire prevention restrictions, the Certified Burn Manager Program, and establishing the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program.
The Board of Forestry approved the public hearing process for the proposed rule packages during their June 5 meeting: 

629-025-0040 to 629-025-0050
629-042-1005 to 629-042-1065
629-042-2000 to 629-042-2060
629-043-0020 to 629-043-0030
629-047-0010 to 629-047-0100

See the agency’s rules website to access notices of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. The department consulted a Rulemaking Advisory Committee representing a wide variety of stakeholder interests while drafting the proposed rules. 
The prevention rules align fire prevention, equipment requirements for fire suppression and use of fireworks on public lands to increase wildfire prevention efforts. Certified Burn Manager proposed rules intend to advance the maturity of the Certified Burn Manager Program. Proposed rules also establish the Prescribed Fire Liability Pilot Program described in Senate Bill 80 (2023) and HB 4016 (2024).
Comment can be made at the virtual public meeting below:

July 30, 10 a.m., Zoom meeting
July 30, 3 p.m., Zoom meeting

Comments can also be sent to ryan.miller@odf.oregon.gov until 5 p.m. on Aug. 15. Please clarify which rule your comments pertain to in your email.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SALEM, Ore. — Public hearings are scheduled July 31 and Aug. 1 to gather feedback on a rules package establishing the contested case appeals process, designating properties in wildfire hazard zones, and identifying the wildland-urban interface, as required by Senate Bill 762 (2021) and Senate Bill 80 (2023). 
The Board of Forestry approved the public hearing process for the proposed rule package, Oregon Administrative Rules 629-001-0001 to 0057 and 629-044-1000 to 1041, during their June 5 meeting. See the notice of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. The department consulted a Rulemaking Advisory Committee representing a wide variety of stakeholder interests while drafting the proposed rules. 
The rules will be used by Oregon State University to address irrigated agriculture as a mitigating factor to assessing wildfire hazard in the statewide wildfire hazard map, which includes assigning one of three hazard zones to individual properties. The rules also establish the process to appeal assignment of a hazard zone or classification.
Comment can be made at any of the virtual public meetings below:

July 31, 10 a.m., Zoom meeting
July 31, 2 p.m., Zoom meeting
Aug. 1, 6 p.m., Zoom meeting

Comments can also be sent to maprules@odf.oregon.gov until 5 p.m. on Aug. 15. Please clarify which rule your comments pertain to in your email.]]></summary>
