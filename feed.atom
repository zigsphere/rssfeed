        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Roseburg Fire Department and Central Douglas Fire & Rescue Authority will be actively engaging in wildland fire training exercises on Reservoir Hill on June 24, 26, and 28, 2024.  During the training exercises, live burning will occur throughout the day.  Training will begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m. each day. Firefighters may remain at the training location for an extended period after training has concluded for site cleanup.  The training exercises will occur on City owned property.  The live burn training will occur on three separate portions of the hillside to allow for training on each of the days.  In preparation for the training exercises, firefighters will be conducting small, controlled burns on June 18, 2024, to assist with protection of the nearby residential properties and City of Roseburg assets before the larger burns begin on June 24, 2024.
The training objectives will include refresher training on wildland firefighting tactics in conjunction with local fire agencies, continued training on command and control procedures for multi-unit incident response and eliminating fuels in an effort to minimize the threat of an uncontrolled burn in the area.  This training opportunity provides the ability to not only train together, but also to improve the effectiveness of interoperability between multiple agencies.
As always, safety will be the number one priority for personnel participating in the training.  The City of Roseburg Fire Department would like to thank the City of Roseburg Police Department for providing additional assistance.  Media wishing to interview a Public Information Officer regarding this training exercise are encouraged to contact Staff Assistant Amy Rice at 541.492.6727 or arice@cityofroseburg.org to coordinate an allotted time with a Public Information Officer at the training site.]]></summary>

Preliminary investigation indicated a 2019 Ford F-550, operated by Bowan Middlesworth (20) of Azalea, was traveling eastbound on S.E. Oak Street through a red light when a 2012 Toyota Prius, operated by Gene Manor (69) of Roseburg, struck the side of the F-550 near the rear axle.
Manor was declared deceased at the scene.  The passenger of the Toyota Prius, Christopher Ronan (57) of Roseburg, suffered a broken arm.  Neither occupant appeared to be wearing their seatbelts.
The operator of the F-550, Middlesworth, was not injured.
Traffic at the intersection was impacted for approximately 3 hours during the on-scene investigation.  The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
The Roseburg Police Department was assisted by the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office Crash Reconstruction Team and Medical Examiner’s Office, the Roseburg Fire Department, Umpqua Valley Ambulance and the Oregon Department of Transportation.]]></summary>
