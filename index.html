                              <span>At 5:47 a.m. on August 31, 2024, firefighters responded to a residential structure fire with reported smoke inside the home. Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single-family residential structure with flames and smoke showing from the back portion of the structure. Upon arrival, firefighters found a male resident and his dog were still inside the structure.  The resident and his dog were able to exit the home on their own at the direction of the firefighters.
Fire crews entered the single-family residence and made an interior attack. Crews extinguished the fire found to be in the attic space and completed overhaul of the structure.  The single-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage. A fire investigator responded to the scene of the fire. The cause of the fire was determined to be electrical in nature.  Umpqua Valley Ambulance evaluated the resident for smoke inhalation. The resident refused treatment. Both the resident and his dog survived the fire.
Ten firefighters assisted with firefighting operations. Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Central Douglas Fire &amp; Rescue, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power. 
The Roseburg Fire Department would like to remind everyone of the importance of working smoke alarms and ensuring you have the appropriate number of smoke alarms installed in the home. Remember to make sure you have working smoke alarms on every level of your home, outside each sleeping area and in every bedroom. Roseburg Fire Department recommends that homeowners consider a home fire sprinkler system for increased protection.</span>

                              <span>DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - On Friday, August 30, 2024, at 1:30 p.m., Douglas County Deputies received information from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department that a kidnapping suspect&#x27;s phone was near the Love&#x27;s Travel Stop in the Green District.
Detectives from Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Office indicated that 53-year-old David James and 39-year-old Tiffany Bryant had taken their children, ages 4 and 2, from a supervised visit and fled with them against child custody orders on August 14, 2024. The pair were believed to be in a brown Buick Enclave SUV and both had active warrants out of California for Kidnapping. A California Amber Alert had been issued for the children but had not been activated in Oregon.
Douglas County Deputies, along with multiple other agencies, began searching. Approximately 1 hour later at 2:29 p.m., a Deputy located the vehicle at the 103 Chevron in Tri-City which was unoccupied. They located David James inside of the Chevron and took him into custody.
During an interview with Detectives, James agreed to show law enforcement where Bryant and the children were and took them to a camp approximately 12 miles out Cow Creek Road. Once on scene, deputies located the children in the company of Bryant who was taken into custody. The Oregon Department of Human Services - Child Welfare Division was contacted and took custody of the children.
James and Bryant were lodged at the Douglas County Jail on the Kidnapping warrants out of California. Douglas County Detectives continue to assist the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department with the investigation.
Assisting agencies included the Oregon State Police, Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team, Myrtle Creek Police Department and Oregon Department of Human Services – Child Welfare.</span>
