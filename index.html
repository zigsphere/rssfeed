                              <span>On Monday, October 14th, detectives with the Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) were assisted by the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in bringing to conclusion a month long investigation into suspected drug trafficking.  
At approximately 8:30 PM, a Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle on I-5 at milepost 161 near Curtin, at the request of DINT detectives.  Two persons were detained:  45 year old Jeffrey Bell, and 45 year old Annie Randles, both of Roseburg.
During a search of the vehicle, detectives found approximately 2 pounds of suspected methamphetamine.  Detectives followed up with a search of a residence in the 900 block of Shoestring Road in Riddle where they found more evidence of drug trafficking.  
Jeff Bell was lodged at the Douglas County Jail on charges of Possession, Manufacturing, and Delivery of Methamphetamine.  
Annie Randles was cited and released on charges on Unlawful Possession and Delivery of Methamphetamine.
 
The Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) is a multi-jurisdictional narcotics task force that identifies, disrupts, and dismantles local, multi-state, and international drug trafficking organizations using an intelligence-driven, multi-agency prosecutor-supported approach.  DINT is supported by the Oregon-Idaho High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) and is composed of members from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Roseburg Police Department, Oregon State Police, Douglas County District Attorney’s Office, and the Bureau of Land Management.
The Oregon-Idaho HIDTA program is an Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) sponsored counterdrug grant program that coordinates with and provides funding resources to multi-agency drug enforcement initiatives, including DINT.</span>

                              <span>RIDDLE, Ore. - A Myrtle Creek man died in a motorcycle vs. vehicle crash on Riddle Bypass Road Friday night. 
Shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Friday, October 11, 2024, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a motorcycle vs. vehicle crash on Riddle Bypass Road near the intersection with E Street in Riddle.
