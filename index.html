Preliminary investigation indicated a 2019 Ford F-550, operated by Bowan Middlesworth (20) of Azalea, was traveling eastbound on S.E. Oak Street through a red light when a 2012 Toyota Prius, operated by Gene Manor (69) of Roseburg, struck the side of the F-550 near the rear axle.
Manor was declared deceased at the scene.  The passenger of the Toyota Prius, Christopher Ronan (57) of Roseburg, suffered a broken arm.  Neither occupant appeared to be wearing their seatbelts.
The operator of the F-550, Middlesworth, was not injured.
Traffic at the intersection was impacted for approximately 3 hours during the on-scene investigation.  The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
The Roseburg Police Department was assisted by the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office Crash Reconstruction Team and Medical Examiner’s Office, the Roseburg Fire Department, Umpqua Valley Ambulance and the Oregon Department of Transportation.</span>
