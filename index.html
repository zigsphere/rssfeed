                              <span>ROSEBURG, Ore. – A Sutherlin woman died of an apparent suicide while in custody at the Douglas County Jail.
On Monday, October 14, 2024, at approximately 5:40 pm, a deputy discovered a female adult in custody (AIC) unresponsive in a holding cell from an apparent suicide attempt. Deputies immediately summoned emergency services and began life saving efforts. The AIC, identified as 38-year-old Katrina Nicole Robertson of Sutherlin, was transported by ambulance but could not be revived.
“My heartfelt condolences are extended to Ms. Robertson’s family,” Sheriff Hanlin said. “The safety and security of those in our custody is of utmost importance to me as Sheriff. In the interest of providing an independent investigation into this tragedy, I have requested the assistance of an outside agency. I wish to thank the Roseburg Police Department for assuming this investigation and conducing a thorough review of the facts.”
Any further information will be released by the Roseburg Police Department.</span>

                              <span>PRINEVILLE, Ore. – Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District will terminate regulated-use closure at 12:01 a.m., Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2024. Fire season remains in effect across the Central Oregon District.
“We caution the public to be mindful of activities which could start a fire as we continue to slowly ease into winter. Periods of dry windy weather are possible and can be a threat into November,” says Brandon Ferguson, Forest Resources Manager for the John Day Unit. “While fire danger has lessened with cooler nights and increased humidity, we can still have rapidly spreading fires during the heat of the day.”
Wildland fuels, including live vegetation and down wood material are extremely dry. Limited precipitation, combined with long-term drought conditions continue to elevate the risk of fire ignition and increase fire behavior in wildland fuels. Fire managers regularly evaluate conditions to determine current fire danger and necessary restrictions to limit impacts from wildfires.
During fire season backyard debris burning, including burn barrels is allowed by permit only. Many counties have burn bans in place prohibiting debris burning at this time. Check restrictions in your local area to help prevent wildfires.
With the termination of regulated-use closure, chainsaw use and mowing restrictions are lifted and small warming/recreational fires may be allowed on ODF-protected lands unless restricted locally.
Failure to follow fire season restrictions can result in citations, fines, and liability for costs associated with putting fires out. Wildfires impact public health, water quality, soil productivity, landowners, and local communities and businesses.

                              <span>On Monday, October 14th, detectives with the Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) were assisted by the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in bringing to conclusion a month long investigation into suspected drug trafficking.  
At approximately 8:30 PM, a Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle on I-5 at milepost 161 near Curtin, at the request of DINT detectives.  Two persons were detained:  45 year old Jeffrey Bell, and 45 year old Annie Randles, both of Roseburg.
During a search of the vehicle, detectives found approximately 2 pounds of suspected methamphetamine.  Detectives followed up with a search of a residence in the 900 block of Shoestring Road in Riddle where they found more evidence of drug trafficking.  
Jeff Bell was lodged at the Douglas County Jail on charges of Possession, Manufacturing, and Delivery of Methamphetamine.  
Annie Randles was cited and released on charges on Unlawful Possession and Delivery of Methamphetamine.
 
The Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) is a multi-jurisdictional narcotics task force that identifies, disrupts, and dismantles local, multi-state, and international drug trafficking organizations using an intelligence-driven, multi-agency prosecutor-supported approach.  DINT is supported by the Oregon-Idaho High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) and is composed of members from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Roseburg Police Department, Oregon State Police, Douglas County District Attorney’s Office, and the Bureau of Land Management.
The Oregon-Idaho HIDTA program is an Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) sponsored counterdrug grant program that coordinates with and provides funding resources to multi-agency drug enforcement initiatives, including DINT.</span>
