IDLEYLD PARK, Ore - The Sheriff&#x27;s Office has downgraded a previous evacuation Level 2 - SET near Lemolo Lake to a Level 1 - BE READY evacuation notice due to a reduced safety risk to the public.
The area being downgraded to a LEVEL 1 - BE READY includes the following:
• Lemolo KOA Campground
• Poole Creek Campground/Boat Ramp
• East Lemolo Campground
• USFS 2614 Road south of Inlet Campground. This includes the Kelsay Valley, Pumice Flat and Elbow Butte Areas
The downgrade is effective on August 6, 2024, at 7:00 pm.
A LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.
Although the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that the United States Forest Service has a significant forest closure in place, which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service.
A current interactive evacuation map can be found on our website at https://www.dcso.com/evacuations.</span>
