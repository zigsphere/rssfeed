                              <span>DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. – A 43-year-old Sutherlin woman has been rescued from the wilderness area outside of Reedsport.
Mandy Greer was picking mushrooms in the vicinity of Camp Creek Road east of Loon Lake on Tuesday afternoon. She and her significant other had only planned to be out for a few hours.
Just before 5 pm Tuesday, October 29th, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a call from her companion advising they had split up while picking mushrooms, and Greer hadn’t returned to their shared vehicle as planned.
Deputies and Search and Rescue responded and spent several hours searching for Greer in response to this report. Search efforts included ground, fixed wing aircraft and drone work. A drone operator identified potential heat signatures, but searchers did not locate Greer. Efforts were paused in the early morning hours but resumed Wednesday morning.
On Wednesday, Douglas County Search and Rescue received resources from the Jackson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Search and Rescue unit to assist in search efforts which resumed at 7:00 am.
At approximately 9:15 am, a deputy was able to make voice contact with Greer who responded to the deputy&#x27;s siren sound sweep. Searchers learned Greer was injured and would need assistance in extracting from the forest. When rescuers located Greer, it was determined she had suffered a non-life-threatening injury, was cold and wet.
Rescuers provided first aid, food and hot tea before assisting Greer to the roadway where she was transferred to the care of EMS providers.
The Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office was assisted by Douglas County Search and Rescue, Jackson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Search and Rescue, Oregon State Police Aircraft Unit, Sutherlin Police, and Umpqua Valley Ambulance.</span>

                              <span>Salem, Ore. – The Oregon Department of Forestry is excited to welcome home 13 firefighters after a two-week deployment in North Carolina to assist in Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. The crew supported the North Carolina Forest Service in state forest clean up, wildfire initial attack and other assignments. To date, they accomplished over 55 miles of clearing roads and trails, averaging about three to five miles a day.  
“It was an honor and a privilege to work with such an outstanding group of individuals,” said Dave Larson, ODF’s Agency Representative for the assignment and Southern Oregon Area Director.  
The crew was mobilized on October 9 to North Carolina with a simple instruction: to help wherever needed. Upon landing, they almost immediately saw the level of devastation and were …</span>

                              <span>Salem, Ore.— The Oregon Department of Forestry is happy to announce the launch of the Prescribed Fire Liability Program. This pilot program is intended to increase use of prescribed fire and cultural burning and support fire practitioners by providing liability coverage for enrolled burns.
Introducing periodic fire to fire-adapted landscapes and reducing forest fuels has been shown to lessen the potential for high-intensity wildfires and the large volume of smoke they produce. 
While the rates of escape and loss are very low due to the careful planning and preparation required for prescribed fire and cultural burning, there is always some residual risk when working with fire. This risk, and the resulting liability for damages due to escape if uninsured, can deter some practitioners from using beneficial fire.
Governor Kotek signed House Bill 4016 in 2024 establishing the pilot Prescribed Fire Liability Program. It authorizes claims covering certain losses arising from escaped prescribed fires and cultural burns. Participation in the program is voluntary.
For your burn to have liability coverage under the program, all the following conditions must be met: 

The burn is enrolled in the program prior to burning.
The burn is conducted or supervised by an appropriate party for the burn.
Ensure the burn follows all applicable laws related to the burn (obtain and follow any required permits/burn plan, make required notifications for Certified Burn Manager-led burns, additional paperwork/ submissions for Power Driven Machinery, etc.).
If the burn escapes, the fire must not be a result of willful, malicious, or negligent actions in the origin or subsequent spread.
