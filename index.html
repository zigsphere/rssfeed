                              <span>DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - In coordination with fire managers, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office has downgraded a previous evacuation Level 2 - SET at Diamond Lake to a Level 1 - BE READY evacuation notice. 
The area being downgraded to a LEVEL 1 - BE READY includes the following: 

Diamond Lake Horse Corrals
Diamond Lake Campground (east side of the lake) - ALL 238 sites, all loops A-M.
Diamond Lake RV Park - All 110 sites.

The downgrade is effective on July 26, 2024 at 3:15 pm.
A LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.
Although the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that there is a significant forest closure which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service. 
An interactive evacuation map can be found on our website at https://www.dcso.com/evacuations.</span>

                              <span>THE DALLES, Ore. – The Great Basin Complex Incident Management Team 6, led by Incident Commander Mack McFarland, assumed command of the Microwave Tower Fire at 6:00 a.m. this morning, Wednesday, July 24, 2024. The Complex Incident Management Team brings additional resources and management capabilities to implement a full suppression strategy for the Microwave Tower Fire. 
The fire has seen moderate activity with intermittent single tree torching, some flanking and smoldering creating a moderate amount of smoke. The fire also saw growth backing down the north slope. With the expected increased winds today, crews are ready to address increased fire behavior. There is a potential for increased smoke in the area.
More accurate mapping has sized the fire at 704 acres and 0% containment. The fire is located 5 miles west, southwest of Mosier, OR. Currently there are approximately 72 personnel assigned to the fire. They are building a combination of dozer and hand line on the southern edge to contain the fire. Additionally, crews are working to improve roads, trails and previously constructed contingency lines around the remainder of the fire.
The Microwave Tower Fire was first detected on July 22, 2024 and the cause is currently under investigation.
