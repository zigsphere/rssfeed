                              <span>ROSEBURG, Ore. - K9 Zoro tracked and apprehended a man with multiple felony warrants who fled from police Thursday afternoon.
On January 25, 2024, at 12:13 pm, Officers with the Roseburg Police Department responded to a residence in the 1900 block of SE Douglas Avenue believing that 24-year-old Devin Goodman was there. Goodman, of Roseburg, had multiple warrants for his arrest and was reported to be possibly armed.
When officers arrived, they observed Goodman flee from the back of the residence and gave chase. K9 Zoro from the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office responded and searched the area. K9 Zoro located Goodman hiding in heavy brush. He attempted to push K9 Zoro back and refused to comply with commands. K9 Zoro apprehended Goodman who was taken into custody by officers.
Goodman was evaluated for non-life-threatening injuries and was lodged in the Douglas County Jail.
K9 Zoro, a 6-year-old German Shepherd, has been with the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office since September 2019. He was purchased by an anonymous donor in the community and gifted to the agency. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office K9 program, consisting of three Patrol K9 teams and 1 narcotics K9 team, is supported financially by private donations and the Friends of Umpqua Valley Police K9 Programs, a non-profit organization whose mission is to support local police K9 teams. Bailey&#x27;s Veterinary Clinic provides medical care and some food for the Sheriff&#x27;s Office K9 program while Coastal Farm and Home Supply provides food while grooming is provided by K-9 Designs.</span>

                              <span>SUTHERLIN, Ore. - A wanted man eluded law enforcement Wednesday evening following a vehicle pursuit. 
On Wednesday, January 24, 2024, shortly after 5:00 pm, a deputy attempted to stop a silver 2008 Ford Focus near the 800-block of John Long Road in Oakland. The driver failed to stop for the deputy and attempted to elude at a high rate of speed driving southbound on Interstate 5. 
Near the Oakland exit, a Sutherlin Police Officer was able to successfully deploy spike strips on the eluding vehicle. The driver of the Focus later crashed into a ditch and fled on foot near Interstate 5, Exit 136 in Sutherlin. The driver of the vehicle, later identified as Billy James Best of Seaside, Oregon, was believed to be armed with a handgun. Law enforcement issued a “reverse 9-1-1” call to the area using an alerting system to notify area residents.
DCSO, Sutherlin Police Department and Oregon State Police searched the area for hours with assistance of canines without success. Best has multiple warrants for his arrest including new crimes committed during the elude. 
There remains a heavy law enforcement presence in the area searching for Best, although it is believed he has likely left the area. “We ask the community to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to 9-1-1,&quot; Lt. Brad O&#x27;Dell said.
A female passenger, Christina Marie Dominguez of Cave Junction was taken into custody for Unlawful Possession of Methamphetamine.
Best is described as a white male adult, approximately 6&#x27;00&quot; tall weighing approximately 200 lbs, with several tattoos. He was last seen wearing dark clothing at the time he ran from police. Booking photos of Best from 2022 are being released to assist in his apprehension.</span>
