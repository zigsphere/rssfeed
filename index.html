While there, detectives contacted 62 year old John Hopkins, who had been living at the site for an extended period of time.  Detectives discovered Hopkins is a registered sex offender, with a listed address in the Sutherlin area, rather than his actual address on Hooker Road.  registered sex offenders are required by law to report any change of address within 10 days.  
 
Additionally, a search of Hopkins&#x27; residence revealed two firearms which Hopkins is prohibited from possessing due to his status as a prior convicted felon.  
 
Hopkins was arrested and lodged at the Douglas County Jail on one count of Failure to Report as a Sex Offender, and two counts of Felon in Possession of a Firearm.</span>
