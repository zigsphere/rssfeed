                              <span>RIDDLE, Ore. - A Myrtle Creek man died in a motorcycle vs. vehicle crash on Riddle Bypass Road Friday night. 
Shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Friday, October 11, 2024, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a motorcycle vs. vehicle crash on Riddle Bypass Road near the intersection with E Street in Riddle. 
Deputies, along with fire and ambulance personnel, responded to the scene. Deputies learned that 81-year-old Warren Currier of Riddle was operating a 2007 Toyota Tacoma southbound on Riddle Bypass Road when he began a lefthand turn onto E Street.

Matthews was pronounced deceased at the scene. Warren was transported by ambulance to Mercy Medical Center for treatment of his injuries. 
The roadway was closed for approximately five hours as deputies conducted the scene investigation.
