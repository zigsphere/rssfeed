                              <span>SANTIAM STATE FOREST, Ore. – The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) is reopening one of the true gems of the state forests’ recreations areas, Butte Creek Falls, on June 21.
The drive into the recreation area goes though ridges and valleys of burned and blacken trees from the 2020 fires.  The deadly Beachie Creek fires killed several people, destroyed homes and scorched more than 400,000 acres.  However, near the recreation area the trees turn green and the area around the upper and lower waterfalls are lush and untouched by fire.
“We were really fortunate the fires skipped over this area,” said Joe Offer, ODF’s Recreation Program Manager.  “The trailhead and the paths to the two sets of falls are open, so is the camping area and the 100-yard shooting range.”

Officials from the US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF), and US Fish and Wildlife Service host the yearly training to prepare new firefighters for the rigors of fighting fire, both in Oregon&#x27;s forests and in rural-urban interface areas.
Co-Incident Commanders Chris Mushrush, Fire Planner for Northwest Oregon Interagency Fire Management, and Craig Pettinger, District Forester for ODF South Cascade District, are leading the effort to train firefighters in tactical skills and safety.

                              <span>DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - The Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office will be hosting three separate boat safety inspection clinics.   
This is a free opportunity to have a boat of any kind inspected to ensure it meets all legal requirements for the upcoming boating season. This is a great way to ensure boaters have all of the required safety equipment, learn about lifejacket safety or boating laws and ask any boating related questions of marine deputies.
The motorized inspection process will include checking for:
• Approved life jackets
• Working fire extinguishers
• Approved Type IV floatation devices
• Approved sound producing devices
• Working engine blower fans (if required)
• Assist with proper placement of Oregon registration numbers and registration stickers
Deputies can also answer questions about non-motorized boats and the requirements pertaining to them. Any non-motorized boat, including paddlecraft, 10&#x27; or longer are required to have a waterway access permit. 
The clinics will be at the following locations: 

SUTHERLIN BI-MART - Saturday, June 22, 2024, 12pm - 4pm
ROSEBURG BI-MART - Saturday, June 29, 2024, 12pm - 4pm
SALMON HARBOR MARINA (Winchester Bay) - Saturday, July 6, 2024, 1pm - 5pm

If the boat passes inspection, a 2024 inspection sticker will be issued.</span>
