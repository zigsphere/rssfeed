                              <span>OAKLAND, Ore. - On Friday, March 1, 2024, shortly after 2:30 p.m., Sutherlin Police Department attempted to stop a stolen 2017 Nissan Rogue on W. Central Avenue near Ponderosa Drive in Sutherlin. The suspect failed to stop and attempted to elude officers in the stolen vehicle.
The suspect crashed and fled on foot in the 600-block of Fawn Ridge Drive in Oakland. A perimeter was established and a Sheriff’s Office K9 was requested to respond to the scene.
K9 Eros responded and began to track the suspect from his last known location. During the track, Eros located clothing that had been worn by the suspect. K9 Eros eventually lead officers to a red pump house indicating the suspect was inside. Deputies began giving announcements that the suspect had been located by the K9 and should surrender. The suspect, 50-year-old Kevin Wade Davison of Roseburg, opened the door to the pump house and gave up without further incident.
Davison was taken into custody and lodged at the Douglas County Jail by Sutherlin Police Officers on their case.
K9 Eros, a 4.5-year-old German Shepherd, has been with the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office since November 2021. He was purchased by an anonymous donor in the community and gifted to the agency. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office K9 program, consisting of three Patrol K9 teams and 1 narcotics K9 team, is supported financially by private donations and the Friends of Umpqua Valley Police K9 Programs, a non-profit organization whose mission is to support local police K9 teams. Bailey&#x27;s Veterinary Clinic provides medical care and some food for the Sheriff&#x27;s Office K9 program while Coastal Farm and Home Supply provides all other food. The agency’s current K9 program has been highly active since 2013.</span>

                              <span>MYRTLE CREEK, Ore. - A Riddle teenager died Friday evening in a single vehicle crash.
On March 1, 2024, at approximately 10:30 pm, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a single vehicle crash with injuries in the 15000-block of North Myrtle Road in Myrtle Creek.

                              <span>SALEM, Ore. – Today the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) deployed a strike team to Amarillo, Texas to assist in their wildfire suppression efforts. The strike team is equipped with five engines and a strike team leader, with a total of 16 firefighters traveling down to the state.  
The firefighters are going to Texas under mutual assistance agreements, making it easier to share resources. When wildfire activity is low in Oregon, firefighters can be spared to help in other places experiencing high levels of wildfire response. 
“We’re ready and willing to help whenever we receive the call from one of our partner states,” said Chris Cline, ODF’s Interim Fire Protection Division Chief.  “It’s the right thing to respond when someone is in a time of need, and we are honored to have the opportunity to serve.”
So how does Oregon send resources to help other states? This is all done through mutual assistance agreements creating a cache of reciprocal resources and a larger more comprehensive fire management system. In this system, Oregon does not only send out resources, but also receives and has received helpful resources when local capacity becomes overwhelmed.
 “The relationships built through our assistance in other states not only benefits them, but also Oregonians as we reach out for help when our fire season hits its peak.” Cline explained. In the 2023 fire season, Oregon received 173 out-of-state firefighters. 
Sending our firefighters on these out-of-state deployments helps them build relationships outside of our organization, learn new suppression tactics and gives them the opportunity to fight fire in a different landscape. These off-season deployments keep their skills sharp so they can come back to Oregon with new knowledge that can be applied to our future fire seasons.</span>
