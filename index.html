                              <span>𝐈𝐃𝐋𝐄𝐘𝐋𝐃 𝐏𝐀𝐑𝐊, 𝐎𝐫𝐞. - Search and Rescue efforts continue in the search for Rachel Merchant-Ly, a Glide Elementary kindergarten teacher whose vehicle was found crashed in the North Umpqua River.
Merchant-Ly was reported missing on Thursday, February 29th when she didn&#x27;t arrive at school. A Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy located signs of a motor vehicle crash near milepost 41 on Highway 138E.
On Friday, March 1, 2024, Merchant-Ly&#x27;s vehicle was recovered from the North Umpqua River, but she was not found inside.
Since that time, nearly 300 hours volunteer hours of searching has taken place. Douglas County Search and Rescue has been using various methods of searching to include drone, ground and K9. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office Marine Patrol has conducted water searches as well. Volunteers have searched along the riverbank from the crash site to Idleyld Park Trading Post; approximately 21 miles.
&quot;We all want to find Mrs. Merchant-Ly and return her to her family,&quot; Sheriff John Hanlin said. &quot;Our deputies are in constant communication with her family and providing them with updates as to our efforts. We will continue searching and using all means necessary to accomplish our mission,&quot; Hanlin added.
In addition to the efforts of DCSO and Search and Rescue volunteers, several community members have been actively looking for Merchant-Ly.
&quot;We are aware of rafting guides and groups of rafters who have been launching all in an attempt to assist in finding her. We have also been contacting community members who are walking along the North Umpqua Trail and the highway,&quot; Hanlin said. &quot;As always this community steps forward to care for each other.&quot;
As the weather turns more springlike, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office encourages those recreating around the area to be aware Merchant-Ly is still missing and to report anything which may assist in concluding this missing person case.</span>
