                              <span>SALEM, Ore. — The Regional Forest Practice Committee for northwest Oregon will meet at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 24 at the ODF Forest Grove Office, 801 Gales Creek Road, Forest Grove, OR 97116. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

Division updates
Operator of the Year discussion and voting
Forest Practice Technical Guidance (FPTG) development and stream flow permanence update
E-Notification System (FERNS) changes
Forest resources training strategy
Compliance monitoring update

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.</span>

                              <span>ROSEBURG, Ore. – A Sutherlin woman died of an apparent suicide while in custody at the Douglas County Jail.
On Monday, October 14, 2024, at approximately 5:40 pm, a deputy discovered a female adult in custody (AIC) unresponsive in a holding cell from an apparent suicide attempt. Deputies immediately summoned emergency services and began life saving efforts. The AIC, identified as 38-year-old Katrina Nicole Robertson of Sutherlin, was transported by ambulance but could not be revived.
“My heartfelt condolences are extended to Ms. Robertson’s family,” Sheriff Hanlin said. “The safety and security of those in our custody is of utmost importance to me as Sheriff. In the interest of providing an independent investigation into this tragedy, I have requested the assistance of an outside agency. I wish to thank the Roseburg Police Department for assuming this investigation and conducing a thorough review of the facts.”
Any further information will be released by the Roseburg Police Department.</span>
