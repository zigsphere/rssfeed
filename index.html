                              <span>SCOTTSBURG, Ore. - Detectives are investigating a fatal shooting incident that occurred on Monday in Scottsburg.
On Monday, October 21, 2024, at approximately 12:00 pm, deputies were responding to a reported criminal mischief and assault in the 5000 block of Lutsinger Creek Road.
While deputies were responding, 9-1-1 dispatchers received additional calls from the residents in the area reporting the incident was escalating and reports of gunshots heard.
When deputies arrived, they located 58-year-old Darrel Dow Dodd unconscious with apparent gunshot wounds. Deputies attempted lifesaving efforts, which were unsuccessful.
Detectives with the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Douglas County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office responded to the scene.
Through the investigation, it was learned that Dodd was armed with a weapon, had broken into a residence and began assaulting and strangling a female known to him while threatening to stab her. Another individual attempted to intervene, but Dodd continued his attack. Dodd was shot twice by a third individual.
Detectives are currently investigating the incident as a case of justified defense of another person, based upon the evidence and circumstances of the incident, although the investigation is ongoing. Once the investigation is complete, it will be forwarded to the Douglas County District Attorney&#x27;s Office for review.</span>
