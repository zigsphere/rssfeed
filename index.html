The all-day conference, which has been held in Portland for the past several years in early June will be held this year on Thursday, June 27 at Venue 252 in downtown Eugene.  It is put on by the Oregon Department of Forestry and USDA Forest Service in collaboration with the non-profit organization Oregon Community Trees, whose board members organize and staff the event. 
The conference’s theme – More Housing, More Trees: Giving Oregonians Both – will bring together advocates for more housing, and greater density and infill in existing residential neighborhoods, with advocates for preserving and expanding urban forest canopy to ensure the health and well-being of city residents.

Along with being number two as a state in 2023, Oregon is also home to the number four and number five counties with the most sites in the nation: Jackson County with 75 sites and Deschutes County with 73 sites. These accomplishments would not have been possible without the dedication of community members and those that led the charge.

                              <span>SALEM, Ore. – The Regional Forest Practice Committee for southwest Oregon will meet at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, March 19 at the Douglas Forest Protective Association, located at 1758 NE Airport Rd. in Roseburg. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

ODF updates and member training requirements
Updates and informing post-disturbance harvest rulemaking
HCP update
Planning and priority for guidance development
Forest Practice Technical Guidance comment review

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.</span>
