                              <span>On November 12, 2024 at approximately 8:30 PM, the Roseburg Police Department, along with the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, responded to the 200 block of SE Pine Street, an area referred to as “The Point,” regarding a reported stabbing. When officers arrived, they found 31-year-old Jesse Otha Thomas lying on the bike path with multiple stab wounds. Thomas was transported to Mercy Medical Center by Umpqua Valley Ambulance, with non-life threatening injuries and later released.
The suspect in this case, 45-year-old Joshua Daniel Saunders, fled the scene but was located along the South Umpqua riverbank with the use of a FLIR thermal imaging device.  After a multi-hour standoff, Saunders was tased and taken into custody without further incident.  Saunders was lodged at the Douglas County Jail for Assault 1 and Unlawful Use of a Weapon.
The Roseburg Police Department would like to thank the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office and Umpqua Valley Ambulance for their assistance.
No further details are being released at this time.</span>
