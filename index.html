                              <span>SALEM, Ore. — The Regional Forest Practice Committee for eastern Oregon will meet at 9 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 10 at the ODF Northeast Oregon District office, 611 20th Street, La Grande. To join virtually, please use the Zoom video conference information found on the agenda. To provide public comment, please email forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov. 
The committee’s agenda includes:

Division updates
Operator of the Year discussion and voting
Forest Practice Technical Guidance (FPTG) development
E-Notification System (FERNS) changes
Forest resources training strategy
Compliance monitoring update

The public may attend in-person or online via Zoom. Public comments will be accepted. Requests for an interpreter for the hearing impaired or other accommodations for persons with disabilities should be made at least 72 hours before the meeting by emailing forestresources.committees@odf.oregon.gov.
Regional Forest Practices Committees are panels of citizens – mandated under Oregon law – that advise the Oregon Board of Forestry on current forestry issues and forest management approaches. In 1971, the legislature enacted Oregon’s Forest Practices Act which includes three Regional Forest Practices Committees, serving the Eastern, Northwest, and Southwest regions of the state. Under Oregon law, a majority of the committees’ members must be private forest landowners and logging or forest operations companies.
Oregon’s forests are among the state’s most valued resources, providing a balanced mix of environmental, economic, and social benefits. View more information on the RFPC webpage.</span>

                              <span>ELKTON, Ore. - On Wednesday, October 2, 2024, at 1:38 pm, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a call from the Elkton High School reporting they were in a self-initiated lockdown. The principal reported the lockdown was the result of a student on campus with a firearm. At the time of the call, the student&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown. 
Multiple deputies, along with Sutherlin Police Department and Oregon State Police responded to the scene. While responding, the school called back to indicate they believed the student was no longer on campus. Other area schools were placed in lockdown until the student could be located. 
Deputies eventually contacted the student in the area of Azalea Drive in Elkton. A backpack was recovered, and a Glock replica BB pistol was located inside. 
The student, a 17-year-old male, was taken into custody and lodged at the Douglas County Juvenile Detention Center on the following charges: 

Disorderly Conduct I
Menacing x2
Probation Violation

The Sheriff&#x27;s Office is continuing its investigation working closely with school officials and agency partners.</span>

                              <span>SALEM, Ore. — A rulemaking hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 22 at 10 a.m. to gather public input on administrative rules clarifying definitions related to emergency fire and emergency fire costs. Public comment can be made by joining the Zoom meeting link. See the notice of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. 
The proposed revisions clarify existing language and include recommendations made to the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) by Macias Gini &amp; O&#x27;Connell LLP (MGO), an independent third-party contractor, that reviewed ODF’s financial practices. The proposed amended administrative rules ensure the true costs of wildland suppression costs are accurately accounted for, tracked, reported, and paid for at the statewide level.
Comments can also be sent to nancy.hirsch@odf.oregon.gov until 5 p.m. on Oct. 31. Please clarify which rule your comments pertain to in your email.
For additional information, please visit ODF’s proposed laws &amp; rules website.</span>
