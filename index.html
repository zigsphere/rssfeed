                              <span>GARDINER, Ore. - A Gardiner man has been arrested and lodged in the Douglas County Jail on sex crime charges.
On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at approximately 10:00 am, deputies were dispatched to a reported disturbance in the 70000-block of Highway 101 in Gardiner. After arriving, deputies determined there were no crimes committed during the disturbance.
As deputies were preparing to leave, they learned information that a juvenile had previously reported to an adult that they had been the victim of sexual assault by 36-year-old Eric Thomas Cumming of Gardiner. Cumming is known to the victim.
Deputies began investigating and developed probable cause for the arrest of Cumming. He was taken into custody and transported to the Douglas County Jail where he was lodged on the following charges:

Unlawful Sexual Penetration in the First Degree x10
Sexual Abuse in the First Degree x10

Cumming remains in custody at the Douglas County Jail.</span>

On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at approximately 5:38 pm, 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a man who had been on a pontoon boat with friends at Diamond Lake when he jumped into the water to swim. Shortly after entering the water the victim went under and never resurfaced. 
Marine Deputies, along with a rescue crew from Central Douglas Fire &amp; Rescue and an ambulance from Umpqua Valley responded to the scene. Along with volunteers from the Diamond Lake Resort, crews searched unsuccessfully until dark. The 37-year-old, whose name is being withheld pending next of kin notification, is presumed drowned.
