                              <span>WINCHESTER BAY, Ore. - On Thursday, September 5, 2024, at approximately 2:00 p.m., 9-1-1 dispatchers received information regarding a boating accident in Winchester Bay. The United States Coast Guard had already been activated and was responding to the incident. 
As deputies were responding, the United States Coast Guard advised they located a separate overturned boat with subjects in the water. USGS personnel was able to rescue two subjects from the water, but a third individual was still outstanding. 
Deputies learned 63-year-old James McKeane of Medford had been fishing with his son, 36-year-old Kenneth McKeane of Central Point and a neighbor, 35-year-old Anthony Knight of Medford. After a few hours of ocean fishing, James McKeane was returning to the dock due to weather conditions in his 2020 18&#x27;6&quot; Kingfisher. While progressing into the bay, a large wave crashed into the left side of the boat causing the boat to roll over. All three occupants went into the water without lifejackets. The vessel eventually capsized. 
James McKeane and Knight were rescued by USCG personnel. Lifesaving efforts were initiated on Knight who was unconscious. Both James and Knight were transported to Lower Umpqua Hospital for medical treatment. Efforts to revive Knight were unsuccessful. 
Kenneth McKeane was later located by USCG helicopter on the North Jetty and was airlifted from there to North Bend Hospital. 
As previously mentioned, there was an initial boating accident to which USCG and emergency services were dispatched. The individuals from that incident were located and were determined to be uninjured. No further information is available on that incident at this time. 
Both accidents remain under investigation by the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Marine Division working in coordination with the Oregon State Marine Board.</span>

                              <span>DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - Scammers are posing as officials from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office (DCSO) in an effort to scam community members out of money. Deputies have once again begun receiving reports from people contacted by phone by individuals posing as DCSO employees. 
The scammer will tell the intended victim they have missed some court appearance, failed to appear for jury duty, they owe fines or have a warrant for their arrest and eventually demands payment. The victim is often directed to immediately make payment or they face consequences including arrest. These are tactics that are never utilized by legitimate law enforcement agencies. 
It is critically important for our community to be aware of these tactics and to share them with their friends and family members, especially those who may be vulnerable to falling victim to the scams, such as the elderly members of the community. However, we also wish to remind the community not to focus too much on specific scam tactics; scammers often change their methods over time:

Scammers can easily obtain new phone numbers and will change them often.
Scammers may use “spoof” programs to make the Caller ID show an agency’s actual phone number.  
Scammers may use the names of actual DCSO employees to make the call seem legitimate.  
Scammers may obtain personal information about a victim online including their name, address, phone number, and the names of others in the home. 
Scammers may initially contact victims by mail, email, or through social media.

Due to the technology used in the scam – and the fact that scammers can be located anywhere in the world – it is virtually impossible to track the scammers or to get money back.
“If anyone has any question about a possible scam call, they should call dispatch at (541) 440-4471 and ask to speak to a deputy,” said Lieutenant Brad O&#x27;Dell.  “The most important thing is to not send any money or agree to meet someone to make payment.”</span>

These organizations have demonstrated a complete disregard for our local laws, and environmental protections, creating incalculable damage to our local ecosystems.  It is common to see improper use of toxic chemicals or in many cases using banned chemicals, unp…</span>
