                              <span>Tillamook, Ore—The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) will resume road restrictions this fall in the western part of the Tillamook State Forest to improve deer and elk escapement during hunting season.
Some roads will be closed to motorized use during the general archery and rifle hunting seasons in September, October and November. Selected roads in the Trask, Wilson and Nehalem River areas will be gated and signed. Controlled access during the three-month period is designed to reduce hunting pressure in these areas.
Hunters and other recreational users are welcome to access the gated areas by foot, mountain bike, horse or other non-motorized means.
ODF is partnering with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and Tillamook Chapter of the Oregon Hunters Association in this program. The partnership has been in place 21 years and the location of gates change year to year based on access needs, tree stand conditions and operations. 
Motorized access by ODF staff or contractors working in those areas may occur on occasion. Maps of the road management areas are available at the Tillamook ODF office located at 5005 Third St., Tillamook and online. Click on “Tillamook State Forest Road Report” to find the maps. Maps are also available on the Tillamook State Forest blog. 
For questions or more information about the road management program, contact Scott Bushnell at 503-842-2545, or Paul Atwood at 503-842-2741, both are in the Tillamook ODF office.</span>

                              <span>GARDINER, Ore. - A Gardiner man has been arrested and lodged in the Douglas County Jail on sex crime charges.
On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at approximately 10:00 am, deputies were dispatched to a reported disturbance in the 70000-block of Highway 101 in Gardiner. After arriving, deputies determined there were no crimes committed during the disturbance.
As deputies were preparing to leave, they learned information that a juvenile had previously reported to an adult that they had been the victim of sexual assault by 36-year-old Eric Thomas Cumming of Gardiner. Cumming is known to the victim.
Deputies began investigating and developed probable cause for the arrest of Cumming. He was taken into custody and transported to the Douglas County Jail where he was lodged on the following charges:

Unlawful Sexual Penetration in the First Degree x10
Sexual Abuse in the First Degree x10

Cumming remains in custody at the Douglas County Jail.</span>
