                              <span>ROSEBURG, Ore. - A Level III Sex Offender has been taken into custody after writing a letter to a minor child. 
On Wednesday, January 3, 2024, Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputies received a report that 44-year-old Uriah Shawn Strauss of Roseburg sent a letter to a minor child at a local high school. The letter outlined Strauss&#x27; desire to strike up a romantic relationship with a woman of at least 16-years of age.  
Strauss was located at the Roseburg Rescue Mission where he was interviewed and taken into custody for Attempted Unlawful Contact with a Child. 
The Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office previously notified the public that Strauss, a Level III sex offender, was sending letters that were filled with sexually explicit content, causing alarm and apprehension regarding personal safety to various women in and out of our community. 
“We renew our request that anyone who has received a similar letter from Strauss, especially anyone under the age of 18, to contact our office.”, Lt. Brad O&#x27;Dell said. &quot;We believe that Strauss has likely attempted contact with other juveniles. It is important that we hear from anyone who Strauss has contacted or attempted to contact. 
Strauss was lodged at the Douglas County Jail where he remains in custody.</span>

The first arriving fire crew reported a medium size shop that was fully involved with other structures threatened. A camp trailer parked nearby suffered minor heat damage, the shop and all its contents were a total loss. The cause of the fire is undetermined due to the extent of damage, but it’s believed the fire started from a possible electrical issue from a nearby chicken coop. 
DCFD No.2 responded with 3 fire engines, 1 water tender and 1 Command vehicle, Fire Crews were assisted by Lookingglass Fire department, DCSO, Roseburg PD, and PP&amp;L.</span>
