The committee’s agenda includes:

The Emergency Fire Cost Committee (EFCC) oversees the Oregon Forest Land Protection Fund (OFLPF), established by the Oregon Legislature as a fund with the purpose of equalizing emergency fire suppression costs among the various Oregon Department of Forestry protection districts and forest protective associations. All districts/associations contribute to the fund so that money will be available to any individual district/association to pay fire suppression costs on eligible emergency fires. View more information on the EFCC webpage.</span>

                              <span>Salem, Ore.— The Oregon Department of Forestry is happy to announce the launch of the Prescribed Fire Liability Program. This pilot program is intended to increase use of prescribed fire and cultural burning and support fire practitioners by providing liability coverage for enrolled burns.
Introducing periodic fire to fire-adapted landscapes and reducing forest fuels has been shown to lessen the potential for high-intensity wildfires and the large volume of smoke they produce. 
While the rates of escape and loss are very low due to the careful planning and preparation required for prescribed fire and cultural burning, there is always some residual risk when working with fire. This risk, and the resulting liability for damages due to escape if uninsured, can deter some practitioners from using beneficial fire.
Governor Kotek signed House Bill 4016 in 2024 establishing the pilot Prescribed Fire Liability Program. It authorizes claims covering certain losses arising from escaped prescribed fires and cultural burns. Participation in the program is voluntary.
For your burn to have liability coverage under the program, all the following conditions must be met: 

The burn is enrolled in the program prior to burning.
The burn is conducted or supervised by an appropriate party for the burn.
Ensure the burn follows all applicable laws related to the burn (obtain and follow any required permits/burn plan, make required notifications for Certified Burn Manager-led burns, additional paperwork/ submissions for Power Driven Machinery, etc.).
If the burn escapes, the fire must not be a result of willful, malicious, or negligent actions in the origin or subsequent spread.

Learn more about the program and apply at ODF’s Prescribed Fire Liability Program web page.

At 3:52 p.m. on October 27, 2024, Roseburg Fire Department personnel responded to a reported commercial structure fire at 1739 W. Harvard Avenue.  The reporting party stated the fire was spreading up the exterior wall of the building and into the roof area. 
Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single story, commercial structure with light smoke showing from the roof and flames visible from the backside of the structure. Firefighters extinguished the exterior portion of the fire and checked for possible fire extension inside the structure.  Several doors were forced and access holes made to gain entry and extinguish the small portion that had spread to the interior portion of the structure.
The commercial structure sustained structural, smoke, and water damage. Firefighters remained on scene to complete overhaul.  There were no reported injuries.  A fire investigator was on scene and the cause of the fire is under investigation.  Thirteen firefighters assisted with firefighting operations.  Other agencies assisting with the fire included Central Douglas Fire &amp; Rescue, Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power.</span>
