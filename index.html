The Fire Department realizes that hydrant flushing may cause some inconvenience; however, the flushing program is necessary to ensure the proper functioning and delivery of adequate water from the water mains when needed for fire control.  The community’s cooperation with this hydrant-flushing program is appreciated. 
During the flushing process, customers may experience low water pressure or discolored water. While the water is safe to drink, customers may prefer to wait until it runs clear before drinking or washing clothes and dishes.</span>
