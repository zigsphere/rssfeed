On April 19, 2024, Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Search and Rescue organized a large scale search in their ongoing efforts to locate 27-year-old Rachel Merchant-Ly of Idleyld Park. Merchant-Ly was reported missing on Thursday, February 29, 2024, when she didn&#x27;t arrive at Glide Elementary School where she worked as a kindergarten teacher. Later that morning, a Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy located signs of a motor vehicle crash near milepost 41 on Highway 138E.
On Friday, March 1, 2024, Merchant-Ly&#x27;s vehicle was recovered from the North Umpqua River, but she was not found inside.
Since that time, searchers have conducted numerous searches by water, land, and air without success.
