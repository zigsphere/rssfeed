When officers arrived, they found a 50 year old Roseburg man was injured due to a stab wound and immediately began life-saving efforts. The injured male was transported to Mercy Medical Center, then later transferred out of the area for additional treatment.
 A suspect in this case, a 20 year old Roseburg man, fled the scene and has not been located despite efforts from multiple assisting agencies and a DCSO K9 track; investigators found the victim and suspect are known to each other. Roseburg Police detectives, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office detectives, DCSO deputies and Oregon State Police responded to assist and will continue to investigate the matter with assistance from the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office. At this time, there is no known ongoing threat to the general public.</span>

                              <span>DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - A cross country skier was rescued after falling and injuring her ankle Sunday afternoon.
On Sunday, March 31, 2024, at approximately 1:30 p.m. Douglas County 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a 57-year-old woman who fell and injured her ankle while cross country skiing near Mt. Thielsen with her companion. The victim was unable to bear weight on the injured leg and requested assistance.
Deputies activated the Douglas County Search &amp; Rescue team who responded to the area along with volunteers from Diamond Lake Resort. Searchers used snowshoes to hike the four miles into the base of a tree line where they located the victim, Trina Reiter of Eugene and her companion just before 7:45 p.m. Searchers stabilized Reiter&#x27;s injury, placed her in a litter and transported her back to the trailhead. They arrived at the trailhead shortly before 1:30 a.m., to a waiting ambulance. Reiter was evaluated by EMS at the scene and went to the hospital by private vehicle.
&quot;This mission shows the dedication of our search and rescue deputies and volunteers who spent their Easter Sunday assisting someone in our community who was in need of their services,&quot; Lt. Brad O&#x27;Dell said. &quot;This mission was very successful and Trina was extremely thankful for the care and compassion shown to her by Douglas County SAR and Diamond Lake Resort volunteers.&quot;
Douglas County SAR is a division of the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office with approximately 90 active volunteers and two full-time Search and Rescue Deputies.</span>

                              <span>SALEM, Ore.— The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) is holding a public comment period beginning April 1 for proposed rule changes related to post-disturbance timber harvest. Post-disturbance harvest refers to the removal of forest products after catastrophic events such as wildfire, wind, ice, insect or disease damage and is commonly referred to as salvage logging.
This rulemaking is required by Senate Bill 1501 (2022) that was part of the legislation that enacted the Private Forest Accord.
On Feb. 23, 2024, the Board of Forestry directed ODF to complete an analysis of the estimated economic impact of the draft rules and file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The public comment period on the proposed rules will be open from April 1 to May 1 and a rules hearing will be held on April 22 at 1 p.m.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes important details including but not limited to the rule text, how to submit comments, and how to participate in the virtual rule hearing. The analysis of the estimated economic impact will be available on the ODF website before the close of the public comment period. 
More information on this rulemaking effort and ongoing updates can be found on the Proposed laws &amp; rules page of the ODF website.</span>

                              <span>Salem, Ore.—The Oregon Department of Forestry is soliciting applications to join the Smoke Management Advisory Committee. The committee is currently seeking applications to fill one vacancy to represent the public.
Created in 1989, the Smoke Management Advisory Committee (SMAC) provides advice and assistance to the Oregon Department of Forestry Smoke Management Program. The membership of the committee consists of an industrial forestland owner representative, a non-industrial forestland owner representative, a public representative, a Forest Service representative, and a Bureau of Land Management representative. Each representative serves for two-year terms that are renewable after the two-year period.
“This is an opportunity for the public to get involved and make sure that their voice and concerns are heard when it comes to prescribed fire smoke management in Oregon.” Said Stacy McCarter, Mitigation Program Manager. 
Committee members gather for public meetings in Salem twice a year to discuss and provide advice to the Smoke Management Program regarding current prescribed burning and smoke intrusion trends, program fund balance, implementation plan items, and other current issues and projects of the program.
To apply, complete an online questionnaire at https://www.oregon.gov/odf/board/Documents/smac/smac-public-nomination-form-2024.pdf and submit to Stacy McCarter at ODF by email stacy.mccarter@odf.oregon.gov by May 1, 2024.
For specific questions about the committee, please contact Stacy McCarter at 503-701-0236 or stacy.mccarter@odf.oregon.gov. Additional SMAC background information can be found at https://www.oregon.gov/odf/board/Pages/smac.aspx.</span>
