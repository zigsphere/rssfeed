                              <span>WINCHESTER BAY, Ore. - On Thursday, September 5, 2024, at approximately 2:00 p.m., 9-1-1 dispatchers received information regarding a boating accident in Winchester Bay. The United States Coast Guard had already been activated and was responding to the incident. 
As deputies were responding, the United States Coast Guard advised they located a separate overturned boat with subjects in the water. USGS personnel was able to rescue two subjects from the water, but a third individual was still outstanding. 
Deputies learned 63-year-old James McKeane of Medford had been fishing with his son, 36-year-old Kenneth McKeane of Central Point and a neighbor, 35-year-old Anthony Knight of Medford. After a few hours of ocean fishing, James McKeane was returning to the dock due to weather conditions in his 2020 18&#x27;6&quot; Kingfisher. While progressing into the bay, a large wave crashed into the left side of the boat causing the boat to roll over. All three occupants went into the water without lifejackets. The vessel eventually capsized. 
James McKeane and Knight were rescued by USCG personnel. Lifesaving efforts were initiated on Knight who was unconscious. Both James and Knight were transported to Lower Umpqua Hospital for medical treatment. Efforts to revive Knight were unsuccessful. 
Kenneth McKeane was later located by USCG helicopter on the North Jetty and was airlifted from there to North Bend Hospital. 
As previously mentioned, there was an initial boating accident to which USCG and emergency services were dispatched. The individuals from that incident were located and were determined to be uninjured. No further information is available on that incident at this time. 
Both accidents remain under investigation by the Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Marine Division working in coordination with the Oregon State Marine Board.</span>
