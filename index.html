                              <span>The Dalles, Ore. – Firefighters from the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District, U.S. Forest Service, local fire districts and landowners have quickly responded to a wildfire near Friend, OR. Firefighters are under initial attack and will continue operations into the night. The fire is currently burning with moderate-to-high spread, estimated at 3,500 acres in grass and timber fuel types. Containment is at 0%. 
The Larch Creek Fire is located 5 miles southwest of Dufur, OR near Friend, OR. It is burning southeast of Winslow Road in Township 2S Range 13E, which is west of Highway 97.
Last reported resources: 8 engines, 20-person hand crew from USFS Mt Hood, 4 dozers, local landowner resources, and multiple air resources. A Type 3 Central Oregon Fire Management Service team has been ordered and is in route. 
With high temperatures, low humidity, and difficult terrain, suppression efforts are requiring diverse methods of attack, prioritizing safety while protecting life and structures. Increased winds are playing a significant factor in fire behavior. No structures have been reported lost.
Evacuations: Level 3 - GO NOW - Evacuate from Clark Miller Road east to Hix Rd, North to Kingley-Friend Market Rd., South to Badger Creek Rd.
Level 2 - BE SET to evacuate from the following areas: Mc Corkle Rd south to Happy Ridge Rd, East to J Hix Rd, West to FS Rd 2700.

                              <span>On Monday, July 8, 2024 at approximately 3:00 PM, the Roseburg Police Department and emergency personnel responded to the report of a pedestrian hit by a Peterbilt commercial motor vehicle and trailer at the intersection of SE Stephens and SE Douglas Streets.
Preliminary investigation revealed that a commercial motor vehicle and trailer, operated by Dylan York (35), were stopped at a red light, facing southbound, and proceeded through the crosswalk when their light turned green and struck a female who was walking within the crosswalk.
The female was pronounced deceased at the scene by the Douglas County M.E. and has not been identified at this time.  
York was not injured and is cooperating with law enforcement.
The Roseburg Police Department was assisted by the Roseburg Fire Department, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office and the Oregon Department of Transportation.</span>
