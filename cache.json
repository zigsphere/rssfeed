Firefighters arrived on scene to find a single-family residential structure with flames and smoke showing from the back portion of the structure. Upon arrival, firefighters found a male resident and his dog were still inside the structure.  The resident and his dog were able to exit the home on their own at the direction of the firefighters.\nFire crews entered the single-family residence and made an interior attack. Crews extinguished the fire found to be in the attic space and completed overhaul of the structure.  The single-family residence sustained structural, smoke, and water damage. A fire investigator responded to the scene of the fire. The cause of the fire was determined to be electrical in nature.  Umpqua Valley Ambulance evaluated the resident for smoke inhalation. The resident refused treatment. Both the resident and his dog survived the fire.\nTen firefighters assisted with firefighting operations. Other agencies assisting with the fire included Umpqua Valley Ambulance, Central Douglas Fire & Rescue, Roseburg Police Department, Avista Utilities, and Pacific Power. \nThe Roseburg Fire Department would like to remind everyone of the importance of working smoke alarms and ensuring you have the appropriate number of smoke alarms installed in the home.
