          "description": "Salem, Ore.— The Oregon Department of Forestry is happy to announce the launch of the Prescribed Fire Liability Program. This pilot program is intended to increase use of prescribed fire and cultural burning and support fire practitioners by providing liability coverage for enrolled burns.\nIntroducing periodic fire to fire-adapted landscapes and reducing forest fuels has been shown to lessen the potential for high-intensity wildfires and the large volume of smoke they produce. \nWhile the rates of escape and loss are very low due to the careful planning and preparation required for prescribed fire and cultural burning, there is always some residual risk when working with fire. This risk, and the resulting liability for damages due to escape if uninsured, can deter some practitioners from using beneficial fire.\nGovernor Kotek signed House Bill 4016 in 2024 establishing the pilot Prescribed Fire Liability Program. It authorizes claims covering certain losses arising from escaped prescribed fires and cultural burns. Participation in the program is voluntary.\nFor your burn to have liability coverage under the program, all the following conditions must be met: \n\nThe burn is enrolled in the program prior to burning.\nThe burn is conducted or supervised by an appropriate party for the burn.\nEnsure the burn follows all applicable laws related to the burn (obtain and follow any required permits/burn plan, make required notifications for Certified Burn Manager-led burns, additional paperwork/ submissions for Power Driven Machinery, etc.).\nIf the burn escapes, the fire must not be a result of willful, malicious, or negligent actions in the origin or subsequent spread.\n\nLearn more about the program and apply at ODF’s Prescribed Fire Liability Program web page. \nFor more information on prescribed fire and correlating programs, visit ODF’s Prescribed Fire web page.",

          "description": "Salem, Ore.—After a record-breaking year, all Oregon Department of Forestry districts have terminated fire restrictions, marking the end of the 2024 Oregon fire season declaration. With over 1.9 million acres burned across the state, firefighters and resources experienced extreme strain.  \n“This season proved that wildfire in Oregon is not just one agency’s issue but effects ALL Oregonians from government agencies to private landowners to Oregon residents.” Kyle Williams, ODF Deputy Director of Fire Protection, said, “This is our reality, and we need to adjust in response to it.” \nThroughout May and June, the state experienced an average, even below average, season.
