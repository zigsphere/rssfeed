The pair were believed to be in a brown Buick Enclave SUV and both had active warrants out of California for Kidnapping. A California Amber Alert had been issued for the children but had not been activated in Oregon.\nDouglas County Deputies, along with multiple other agencies, began searching. Approximately 1 hour later at 2:29 p.m., a Deputy located the vehicle at the 103 Chevron in Tri-City which was unoccupied. They located David James inside of the Chevron and took him into custody.\nDuring an interview with Detectives, James agreed to show law enforcement where Bryant and the children were and took them to a camp approximately 12 miles out Cow Creek Road. Once on scene, deputies located the children in the company of Bryant who was taken into custody. The Oregon Department of Human Services - Child Welfare Division was contacted and took custody of the children.\nJames and Bryant were lodged at the Douglas County Jail on the Kidnapping warrants out of California. Douglas County Detectives continue to assist the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department with the investigation.\nAssisting agencies included the Oregon State Police, Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team, Myrtle Creek Police Department and Oregon Department of Human Services – Child Welfare.",
