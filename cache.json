          "description": "In May of 2022, Jerry Lee Thacker, now a 57-year-old Roseburg man, was arrested on charges of Rape, Sodomy, Unlawful Sexual Penetration and Sexual Abuse. The alleged victim was a 13-year-old juvenile female and Roseburg resident. On January 9, 2024, Thacker failed to appear for trial resulting in a warrant for his arrest. The Roseburg Police Department began an investigation into Thacker’s whereabouts at that time. Using intelligence gathered during that effort, investigators came to believe Thacker fled to Knoxville, Tennessee and was living with a family member. Our agency reached out to the U.S. Marshals Service in Oregon and requested assistance in apprehending Thacker. The U.S. Marshals Service agreed to take the case and within a short period of time, located Thacker and served the warrant by taking Thacker into custody in the Knoxville, Tennessee area. Thacker was lodged at the Knox County Jail in Tennessee pending extradition. The Roseburg Police Department is very appreciative for the assistance of The U.S. Marshals Service in this case.",
