          "description": "In the evening hours of Tuesday, May 28th, 2024, detectives with the Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) once again arrested a habitual drug offender in the Myrtle Creek area.  Detectives had been investigating the suspected illegal activities of 52 year old Randall Slay, of Myrtle Creek, and had developed reason to believe Slay was driving to a location in the area to make a drug deal.  \n \nWith help from the Douglas County Sheriff's Office, a traffic stop was initiated on Slay and his vehicle in the 900 block of S. Main Street in Myrtle Creek.  Douglas County Sheriff's Office K-9 “Trapper” was tasked to sniff Slay's vehicle for the odor of narcotics.  Trapper gave the alert, indicating he had indeed smelled the odor of narcotics coming from the vehicle.  \n \nDetectives and a deputy located approximately 16.3 grams of suspected methamphetamine in Slay's possession.  In a subsequent search of Slay's vehicle detectives found four more baggies containing various amounts of suspected methamphetamine.  In total, from the traffic stop, detectives seized approximately 173 grams of suspected methamphetamine.  \n \nShortly thereafter a search was conducted of Slay's residence.  At the residence detectives located an additional approximate 134 grams of suspected methamphetamine and several items of drug paraphernalia to include scales, baggies, pipes, scoopers, etc.  \n \nSlay was lodged at the Douglas County Jail on the following charges:\n\nUnlawful Possession of Methamphetamine\nUnlawful Delivery of Methamphetamine\nUnlawful Manufacture of Methamphetamine\n\n \nIn just the last two years, this is the third time Slay has been arrested by DINT.",
