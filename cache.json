In an effort to prioritize the safety of students, staff and faculty, the College elected to cancel all classes, events, and activities until further notice. \nThe Sheriff's Office is working in partnership with the College regarding the threat. There is an increased law enforcement presence on the campus today. \n“The Sheriff's Office takes seriously any threat directed toward the safety of our schools, whether kindergarten or higher education institutions,\" Sheriff Hanlin said. “The Sheriff’s Office, with assistance from the FBI, has determined the source of the email originated from outside the country. At this time the threatening email is not considered credible, and there is no immediate threat to the college.”\nThe specifics of the security threat will not be released by the Sheriff's Office in order to protect the integrity of the investigation. \n\"We are committed to taking all necessary precautions to ensure safe learning and working environments for everyone. We understand that this closure may cause inconvenience to the academic and personal lives of our community, and we appreciate your cooperation and understanding,\" said UCC President, Dr. Rachel Pokrandt.\nAnyone with information may contact the Douglas County Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471.",
