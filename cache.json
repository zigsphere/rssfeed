          "description": "MYRTLE CREEK – Nearly 44 years after Douglas County Deputy Sheriff Allen Burdic was grievously injured and three years after he died from complications of those injuries, a fallen officer memorial highway sign was dedicated in his honor Monday.\n\nODOT workers installed the sign at the Interstate 5 exit 108 interchange near the Myrtle Creek bridge. \nDeputy Burdic confronted a shooting suspect at this location on August 12, 1980. He was shot twice, and his legs were run over when the suspect fled in a stolen patrol vehicle. Burdic suffered a spinal injury and partial paralysis. He continued to receive medical care until he passed away March 11, 2021.\n\nThe memorial dedication was the result of advocacy of his wife, Erlah Burdic, and the efforts of State Representative Christine Goodwin.\n\nAs the sign was installed, Burdic, Goodwin and DCSO Lt. Brad O'Dell addressed a group of attendees including Commissioners Freeman, Boice and Kress, County Clerk Dan Loomis and Canyonville Mayor Christine Morgan. \nMembers of the DCSO honor guard were joined by a Hillsboro PD honor guard member who concluded the ceremony by playing \"Amazing Grace\" on Deputy Burdic's trumpet. \n\nPrior to his injury, Deputy Burdic had served with DCSO for one year and had previously served with the Canyonville Police Department for three years.",
