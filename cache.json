          "description": "DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - Scammers are posing as officials from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office (DCSO) in an effort to scam community members out of money. Deputies have once again begun receiving reports from people contacted by phone by individuals posing as DCSO employees. \nThe scammer will tell the intended victim they have missed some court appearance, failed to appear for jury duty, they owe fines or have a warrant for their arrest and eventually demands payment. The victim is often directed to immediately make payment or they face consequences including arrest. These are tactics that are never utilized by legitimate law enforcement agencies. \nIt is critically important for our community to be aware of these tactics and to share them with their friends and family members, especially those who may be vulnerable to falling victim to the scams, such as the elderly members of the community. However, we also wish to remind the community not to focus too much on specific scam tactics; scammers often change their methods over time:\n\nScammers can easily obtain new phone numbers and will change them often.\nScammers may use “spoof” programs to make the Caller ID show an agency’s actual phone number.  \nScammers may use the names of actual DCSO employees to make the call seem legitimate.  \nScammers may obtain personal information about a victim online including their name, address, phone number, and the names of others in the home. \nScammers may initially contact victims by mail, email, or through social media.\n\nDue to the technology used in the scam – and the fact that scammers can be located anywhere in the world – it is virtually impossible to track the scammers or to get money back.\n“If anyone has any question about a possible scam call, they should call dispatch at (541) 440-4471 and ask to speak to a deputy,” said Lieutenant Brad O'Dell.  “The most important thing is to not send any money or agree to meet someone to make payment.”",

          "description": "Salem, OR— The Oregon Department of Forestry wants to remind Oregonians that with weather fluctuating across the state, fire is still on the landscape and fire season is still in effect. Oregon is still experiencing one of the worst seasons we’ve seen in the past decade, and the department warns the public against complacency. \n“East winds are very common around this time of year, making now the time to prevent the next large wildfire. There is still potential for more fire starts and the season isn’t over yet.” Chris Cline, Fire Protection Division Chief, said. “The fewer human caused fires we have, the less strained our resources will be.”\nEast winds come to the Pacific Northwest every year around the end of August and last through the fall months. They occur from the crest of the Cascad…",

          "description": "Chiloquin, Ore. – Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team 3 was mobilized last night to the Copperfield Fire in the Klamath-Lake District. The team will in brief at 1:00p.m. today and will enter unified command with the Oregon State Fire Marshal’s Red Team at 6:00 p.m. \nThe Copperfield Fire, 5 miles southeast of Chiloquin, is estimated to be 2,500 acres as of this morning. \nResources were successful overnight in laying dozer line from the heel of the fire and up the east and west flanks. Today, they will continue to work on creating dozer line along the north side of the fire to stop forward progression. Multiple air resources are on order today to help with suppression efforts. Southwest to west winds are expected to challenge the eastern fire lines throughout today. \n“Due to unfavorable weather conditions, this is a rapidly evolving incident.” Teresa Williams, Klamath-Lake District Forester said, “We’re grateful to have the help of the incident management teams in managing and working to contain this fire and protect our communities.”\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the area is in a Red Flag Warning until 8 p.m. tonight due to strong winds with gusts up to 40 mph and low humidity. A red flag warning is issued when there are weather conditions that promote rapid spread of fire which may become life-threatening.\nKlamath County Sheriff’s office has declared Level 3 (Go Now) evacuations east of Chiloquin.
