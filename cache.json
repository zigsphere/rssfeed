Deputies initiated resuscitative efforts and dialed 9-1-1 for an ambulance. Once EMS arrived on scene, they took over lifesaving efforts and transported Ruh to Mercy Medical Center. Ruh was later pronounced deceased at the hospital. \nThe Douglas County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating the death. On Tuesday, April 16, 2024, an autopsy was conducted at the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office. Full toxicological screening is pending, but Ruh's death is suspected to be the results of a drug overdose. \nDrug overdose deaths within the community have increased significantly over the past several years. Each overdose death is heartbreaking and has a profound impact on the lives lost and those who knew them.\n\"I send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Ruh,\" Sheriff John Hanlin remarked.\nRuh had been taken into custody by the Roseburg Police Department on Sunday, April 14, 2024, shortly after 10:00 pm. He was being held at the Douglas County Jail on an arrest warrant out of Linn County.",
