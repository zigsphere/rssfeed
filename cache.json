This is a great way to ensure boaters have all of the required safety equipment, learn about lifejacket safety or boating laws and ask any boating related questions of marine deputies.\nThe motorized inspection process will include checking for:\n• Approved life jackets\n• Working fire extinguishers\n• Approved Type IV floatation devices\n• Approved sound producing devices\n• Working engine blower fans (if required)\n• Assist with proper placement of Oregon registration numbers and registration stickers\nDeputies can also answer questions about non-motorized boats and the requirements pertaining to them. Any non-motorized boat, including paddlecraft, 10' or longer are required to have a waterway access permit. \nThe clinics will be at the following locations: \n\nSUTHERLIN BI-MART - Saturday, June 22, 2024, 12pm - 4pm\nROSEBURG BI-MART - Saturday, June 29, 2024, 12pm - 4pm\nSALMON HARBOR MARINA (Winchester Bay) - Saturday, July 6, 2024, 1pm - 5pm\n\nIf the boat passes inspection, a 2024 inspection sticker will be issued.",
