Any non-motorized boat, including paddlecraft, 10' or longer are required to have a waterway access permit. \nThe clinics will be at the following locations: \n\nSUTHERLIN BI-MART - Saturday, June 22, 2024, 12pm - 4pm\nROSEBURG BI-MART - Saturday, June 29, 2024, 12pm - 4pm\nSALMON HARBOR MARINA (Winchester Bay) - Saturday, July 6, 2024, 1pm - 5pm\n\nIf the boat passes inspection, a 2024 inspection sticker will be issued.",
