          "description": "Rain Festival Offers Opportunity for Community Members to Engage and Share Input \nTILLAMOOK, OR, Nov. 8, 2024 – What common values, questions, and even misconceptions about state forests do Oregonians have?  On Nov.16, Lewis & Clark students will engage community members to help answer these questions as part of the Rain Festival being held at Tillamook Forest Center.\nThe Rain Festival is a free event providing the public with activities including a salmon release, guided walks, crafts, and displays that celebrate the Tillamook State Forest and its watersheds. For 19 students studying environmental engagement at Lewis & Clark, the Rain Festival will also be a pivotal opportunity for gathering public input about the perspectives, attitudes, and appreciation that define how Oregonians value our forests. Lewis & Clark Professor Alana Rader has developed the course in collaboration with Denise Berkshire of the Tillamook Forest Center, to deepen students’ engagement and communication skills in real-world settings. The Lewis & Clark students are preparing by designing and refining the public engagement activities for the Rain Festival. Afterwards, the students will analyze the data they gather and make a presentation to the state Board of Forestry to provide perspectives on people’s understanding of, and attitudes toward, Oregon’s state forests. \nMembers of the media are invited to attend the Nov. 16 event, where Rader, Berkshire, and the Lewis & Clark students will be available for interviews about the process and goals of the collaboration. An RSVP to Tim Hoffman and Lori Friedman is requested, but day of coverage is also welcome.\n###",
