The plane bounced off the ground, was launched back into the air and hit the top of a tree with the propeller before taking a nosedive to the ground. \nDeputies responded with firefighters and emergency medical providers from Central Douglas Fire and Rescue and Umpqua Valley Ambulance. \nThe pilot, Steven H. Kretsinger, 65, of Eugene, was pronounced deceased on scene.\nInvestigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were notified of the crash.
