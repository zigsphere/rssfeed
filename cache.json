This includes the Kelsay Valley, Pumice Flat and Elbow Butte Areas\nThe downgrade is effective on August 6, 2024, at 7:00 pm.\nA LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.\nAlthough the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that the United States Forest Service has a significant forest closure in place, which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff's Office evacuation notice process. For current information on the status of the campgrounds and associated forest closure, please contact the United States Forest Service.\nA current interactive evacuation map can be found on our website at https://www.dcso.com/evacuations.",
