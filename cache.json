The letter outlined Strauss' desire to strike up a romantic relationship with a woman of at least 16-years of age.  \nStrauss was located at the Roseburg Rescue Mission where he was interviewed and taken into custody for Attempted Unlawful Contact with a Child. \nThe Douglas County Sheriff's Office previously notified the public that Strauss, a Level III sex offender, was sending letters that were filled with sexually explicit content, causing alarm and apprehension regarding personal safety to various women in and out of our community. \n“We renew our request that anyone who has received a similar letter from Strauss, especially anyone under the age of 18, to contact our office.”, Lt. Brad O'Dell said. \"We believe that Strauss has likely attempted contact with other juveniles. It is important that we hear from anyone who Strauss has contacted or attempted to contact. \nStrauss was lodged at the Douglas County Jail where he remains in custody.",
