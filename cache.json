Callers were reporting a physical disturbance where three men were assaulting another. One caller reported that the men were applying zip-ties to the male to restrain him. \nDeputies arrived on scene and were able to determine that 25-year-old Justin Daniel Devlaeminck, 53-year-old Daniel Terrance Devlaeminck, and 26-year-old Austin Lee Lyman broke into a residence in an effort to “evict” the 22-year-old victim. Justin Devlaeminck pointed a firearm at the victim and Daniel Devlaeminck broke a window to the residence. All three suspects entered the home and began to assault the male victim who tried to escape, but was pulled back. At one point, the victim was able to break away and flee outside where the three suspects captured him and continued their assault and eventually used zip ties to restrain him. \nThe victim was transported to Mercy Medical Center by ambulance for treatment of his injuries. \nAll three suspects were taken into custody and transported to the Douglas County Jail where they were lodged on the following charges: \nDaniel Devlaeminck: Burglary I, Kidnapping I, Assault IV, Criminal Mischief II\nJustin Devlaeminck: Burglary I, Kidnapping I, Assault IV, Menacing, Pointing a Firearm at Another\nAustin Lyman: Burglary I, Kidnapping I, Assault IV\nThe Sheriff's Office was assisted by the Myrtle Creek Police Department, Umpqua Valley Ambulance and Riddle Fire Department.",

          "description": "DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. - Scammers are posing as officials from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office (DCSO) in an effort to scam community members out of money. Deputies have once again begun receiving reports from people contacted by phone by individuals posing as DCSO employees such as Lt. Brad O'Dell and Retired Lt. Mike Root. \nThe scammer will tell the intended victim they have missed some court appearance, owe fines or have a warrant for their arrest and then demands payment. The victim is often directed to immediately make payment or they face consequences including arrest. These are tactics that are never utilized by legitimate law enforcement agencies. \nIt is critically important for our community to be aware of these tactics and to share them with their friends and family members, especially those who may be vulnerable to falling victim to the scams, such as the elderly members of the community. However, we also wish to remind the community not to focus too much on specific scam tactics; scammers often change their methods over time:\n\nScammers can easily obtain new phone numbers and will change them often.\nScammers may use “spoof” programs to make the Caller ID show an agency’s actual phone number.  \nScammers may use the names of actual DCSO employees to make the call seem legitimate.  \nScammers may obtain personal information about a victim online including their name, address, phone number, and the names of others in the home. \nScammers may initially contact victims by mail, email, or through social media.\n\nDue to the technology used in the scam – and the fact that scammers can be located anywhere in the world – it is virtually impossible to track the scammers or to get money back.\n“If anyone has any question about a possible scam call, they should call dispatch at (541) 440-4471 and ask to speak to a deputy,” said Lieutenant Brad O'Dell.  “The most important thing is to not send any money or agree to meet someone to make payment.”",
