          "description": "ROSEBURG, Ore. - A Winston woman has been arrested on charges of animal abuse and neglect.\nDouglas County Sheriff's Office Animal Control deputies began an investigation early this week after receiving a tip of a horse that was reported to be mistreated at a property in the 600-block of Longhorn Lane. During the investigation, deputies learned the horse and property owner had no connection.\nDeputies discovered a 3-year-old mixed breed horse, named Ace, who was found to be severely malnourished and in neglectful conditions. Ace's owner, 24-year-old Morgan Faith Fowler of Winston, surrendered the horse to deputies on Wednesday who took it to a veterinary hospital for examination and later to Strawberry Mountain Rescue and Rehabilitation Center. Overnight, Ace's condition declined to the point that euthanasia was necessary for humane care.\nDeputies contacted Fowler Thursday afternoon and took her into custody for Animal Neglect I and Animal Abuse II. She was transported to the Douglas County Jail where she was booked on those charges.\n\"This is a very severe case of neglect and abuse,\" Sheriff John Hanlin said. \"The Douglas County Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation and will provide all relevant facts to the Douglas County District Attorney's Office.\"\nAnyone who may have information regarding this case is encouraged to contact the Douglas County Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471 referencing case #24-1522.\nSheriff Hanlin expressed his thanks to Bailey Veterinary Clinic, Strawberry Mountain Rescue and Rehabilitation Center and to the deputies and volunteers who worked to save Ace and are now working on holding Fowler accountable. \"These cases are never easy and I cannot thank those who have been involved enough,\" the Sheriff remarked.",

It’s an unusual honor given that the town in northeast Oregon is surrounded by rolling grasslands and was largely treeless except along the Umatilla River when Pendleton was laid out in 1868. Early city residents wasted no time planting trees to buffer the winds and offer shade from the area’s hot summers.\nThat tree-planting tradition has continued to this day. In partnership with the Umatilla National Forest and the volunteer-led Tree Commission, the city annually distributes free trees to residents during an Arbor Day celebration, giving away 250 last year and nearly 700 over the past 4 years.\nA city of more than 16,000 people, Pendleton has maintained its status as a Tree Cit…",
