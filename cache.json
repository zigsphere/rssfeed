          "description": "PRINEVILLE, Ore. – Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District will terminate regulated-use closure at 12:01 a.m., Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2024. Fire season remains in effect across the Central Oregon District.\n“We caution the public to be mindful of activities which could start a fire as we continue to slowly ease into winter. Periods of dry windy weather are possible and can be a threat into November,” says Brandon Ferguson, Forest Resources Manager for the John Day Unit. “While fire danger has lessened with cooler nights and increased humidity, we can still have rapidly spreading fires during the heat of the day.”\nWildland fuels, including live vegetation and down wood material are extremely dry. Limited precipitation, combined with long-term drought conditions continue to elevate the risk of fire ignition and increase fire behavior in wildland fuels. Fire managers regularly evaluate conditions to determine current fire danger and necessary restrictions to limit impacts from wildfires.\nDuring fire season backyard debris burning, including burn barrels is allowed by permit only. Many counties have burn bans in place prohibiting debris burning at this time. Check restrictions in your local area to help prevent wildfires.\nWith the termination of regulated-use closure, chainsaw use and mowing restrictions are lifted and small warming/recreational fires may be allowed on ODF-protected lands unless restricted locally.\nFailure to follow fire season restrictions can result in citations, fines, and liability for costs associated with putting fires out. Wildfires impact public health, water quality, soil productivity, landowners, and local communities and businesses.\nFor additional information on ODF’s Central Oregon District, including regulated-use closure restrictions and contact information, please visit www.ODFcentraloregon.com.",
