This in inclusive of all addresses between these two points. These residences were previously on a Level 2 - Be Set notice as a result of the Pine Bench Fire, which is part of the Diamond Complex.\nA LEVEL 1 - BE READY EVACUATION NOTICE means you should be aware of the danger that exists in the area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movement of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.\nAlthough the evacuation level has been reduced in this area, it is important to know that there is a significant forest closure which may include the above campgrounds. This forest closure is independent of the Sheriff's Office evacuation notice process.

          "description": "During August through the end of September the Roseburg Police Department will have some extra patrols out working traffic enforcement, with a specific focus on safety belt use, distracted driving and speeding.  These focused patrols are made available due to grants received from Oregon Impact and the Oregon Department of Transportation.\nSeat belts have been proven to be one of the best ways to save your life in a crash. Yet many still don’t buckle up. Worse still, not wearing a seat belt is a habit that will pass on to impressionable youth, who in turn will think it’s safe to not buckle up.\nDistracted driving is one of the fastest growing safety issues on the roads today. Distracted drivers aren’t just a threat to themselves: they’re a danger to everyone else on the road. The national distracted driving effort focuses on ways to change the behavior of drivers through legislation, enforcement, public awareness, and education.\nBe on the lookout for specific enforcement campaigns over the next two months.",

          "description": "The Douglas Interagency Narcotics Team (DINT) is currently conducting an investigation into a large amount of suspected methamphetamine located early this week by a citizen in Fir Grove Park in Roseburg.  \n \nLaw Enforcement was contacted after the citizen located what appeared to be two brand new bags of charcoal briquettes in the brush along a trail in the park.  The bags appeared to have been abandoned, and it was suspected they'd been stolen.  The bags were opened and were found to contain a large amount of suspected methamphetamine mixed in with the briquettes.  \n \nThis area is highly populated during the day with kids and citizens utilizing the park and trails. DINT took possession of the bags of briquettes and suspected controlled substances. DINT is seeking information from the public on anyone who may have seen the briquettes being carried into or left at the park. The specific amount of methamphetamine is not being disclosed at this time. \n \nDINT can be contacted at 541-440-4474 or through our web tip line that can be found at DCSO.COM",

          "description": "Sweet Home, Ore.—Feller bunchers, dozers, water tenders and other specialized equipment play a key role in the initial attack and suppression of Oregon’s wildfires.  Much of that equipment is provided by local operators under a contract agreement with the Oregon Department of Forestry.\n“One piece of equipment can do the work of a 40-person crew,” said Craig Pettinger, Oregon Department of Forestry’s interim district forester for its South Cascade district. “It’s not just the equipment but the experienced operators who know the equipment and the terrain of the local area that make them so effective.”\nThe operators sign up their people and equipment through ODF’s Incident Resources Agreement (IRA) program. Applications are typically accepted April through June each year. IRA contractors may …",
