          "description": "On November 9th at 0315 hours, the Roseburg Police Department responded to multiple reports of gunfire in the 1200 block Hamilton Street, in Roseburg.  The responding officers located and identified the shooter as 25 year old Austin Adrian Wall.  The responding officers also located Ryan Dale Burchell ( 50 years of age), who sustained several gunshot wounds.  The officers on scene began life saving efforts for Burchell until relieved by paramedics.  Burchell was transported to Mercy by ambulance, but ultimately succumbed to his injuries at approximately 0921 hours.   \nThe Douglas County Major Crimes team, which includes the Roseburg Police Department, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police, and the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office, has been activated and a comprehensive and ongoing investigation is occurring.  Based on the preliminary investigation,  Wall was taken into custody for Murder II and was lodged at Douglas County Corrections.",
