          "description": "Tillamook, Ore—The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) will resume road restrictions this fall in the western part of the Tillamook State Forest to improve deer and elk escapement during hunting season.\nSome roads will be closed to motorized use during the general archery and rifle hunting seasons in September, October and November. Selected roads in the Trask, Wilson and Nehalem River areas will be gated and signed. Controlled access during the three-month period is designed to reduce hunting pressure in these areas.\nHunters and other recreational users are welcome to access the gated areas by foot, mountain bike, horse or other non-motorized means.\nODF is partnering with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and Tillamook Chapter of the Oregon Hunters Association in this program. The partnership has been in place 21 years and the location of gates change year to year based on access needs, tree stand conditions and operations. \nMotorized access by ODF staff or contractors working in those areas may occur on occasion. Maps of the road management areas are available at the Tillamook ODF office located at 5005 Third St., Tillamook and online. Click on “Tillamook State Forest Road Report” to find the maps. Maps are also available on the Tillamook State Forest blog. \nFor questions or more information about the road management program, contact Scott Bushnell at 503-842-2545, or Paul Atwood at 503-842-2741, both are in the Tillamook ODF office.",
