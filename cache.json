          "description": "Salem, Ore.—The heat of summer makes shade-covered state forest an appealing destination for many.\n“July and August see the most visitors to our state forests,” said Joe Offer, Oregon Department of Forestry’s Recreation Program Manager. “With that increase of visitors is also an increase in wildfire danger since 70 percent of wildfires are human caused.”\nODF posts fire danger levels and public use restrictions on information boards in recreation areas and on most access roads to state forests. There are four levels: Low, Moderate, High and Extreme, with corresponding restrictions for certain activities.
