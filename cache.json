          "description": "DIAMOND LAKE, Ore. - A cross country skier was rescued after falling and injuring her ankle Sunday afternoon.\nOn Sunday, March 31, 2024, at approximately 1:30 p.m. Douglas County 9-1-1 dispatchers received a report of a 57-year-old woman who fell and injured her ankle while cross country skiing near Mt. Thielsen with her companion. The victim was unable to bear weight on the injured leg and requested assistance.\nDeputies activated the Douglas County Search & Rescue team who responded to the area along with volunteers from Diamond Lake Resort. Searchers used snowshoes to hike the four miles into the base of a tree line where they located the victim, Trina Reiter of Eugene and her companion just before 7:45 p.m. Searchers stabilized Reiter's injury, placed her in a litter and transported her back to the trailhead. They arrived at the trailhead shortly before 1:30 a.m., to a waiting ambulance. Reiter was evaluated by EMS at the scene and went to the hospital by private vehicle.\n\"This mission shows the dedication of our search and rescue deputies and volunteers who spent their Easter Sunday assisting someone in our community who was in need of their services,\" Lt. Brad O'Dell said. \"This mission was very successful and Trina was extremely thankful for the care and compassion shown to her by Douglas County SAR and Diamond Lake Resort volunteers.\"\nDouglas County SAR is a division of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office with approximately 90 active volunteers and two full-time Search and Rescue Deputies.",

Post-disturbance harvest refers to the removal of forest products after catastrophic events such as wildfire, wind, ice, insect or disease damage and is commonly referred to as salvage logging.\nThis rulemaking is required by Senate Bill 1501 (2022) that was part of the legislation that enacted the Private Forest Accord.\nOn Feb. 23, 2024, the Board of Forestry directed ODF to complete an analysis of the estimated economic impact of the draft rules and file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The public comment period on the proposed rules will be open from April 1 to May 1 and a rules hearing will be held on April 22 at 1 p.m.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes important details including but not limited to the rule text, how to submit comments, and how to participate in the virtual rule hearing.
