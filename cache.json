          "description": "SALEM, OR – The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) and other fire prevention experts urge the public to exercise caution when disposing of yard debris this spring. Over seventy percent of wildfires in Oregon are human-caused fires, with debris burning being the number one cause. As the weather gets hotter and fuels begin to dry out, the risk of a debris burn escaping increases. \nNow is the time to trim trees, bushes, and tidy up plants around your home to create a “defensible space” around your property. As you begin spring clean-up, the Oregon Department of Forestry and Keep Oregon Green urge you to put some extra thought into how you plan to dispose of your yard debris.\nCall your local ODF office before burning to make sure the weather conditions are safe.
