Through Governor Kotek’s State of Emergency Declaration, ODF is able to order firefighting resources as needed from the National Guard. Since the declaration, the department has already ordered two medevac helicopters and other air support from the National Guard in support of multijurisdictional fires. \n“The wildfire situation on the ground is dynamic and challenging, and we need all hands on deck,” Governor Kotek said. “I want to thank the Oregon National Guard for their dedication and cooperation in fighting Oregon’s wildfires and protecting Oregon’s communities and natural resources.”\nThe four hand crews are comprised of 92 personnel: 22 firefighters per crew, two…",

There are four levels: Low, Moderate, High and Extreme, with corresponding restrictions for certain activities.
