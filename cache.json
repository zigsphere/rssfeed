The principal reported the lockdown was the result of a student on campus with a firearm. At the time of the call, the student's whereabouts were unknown. \nMultiple deputies, along with Sutherlin Police Department and Oregon State Police responded to the scene. While responding, the school called back to indicate they believed the student was no longer on campus. Other area schools were placed in lockdown until the student could be located. \nDeputies eventually contacted the student in the area of Azalea Drive in Elkton. A backpack was recovered, and a Glock replica BB pistol was located inside. \nThe student, a 17-year-old male, was taken into custody and lodged at the Douglas County Juvenile Detention Center on the following charges: \n\nDisorderly Conduct I\nMenacing x2\nProbation Violation\n\nThe Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation working closely with school officials and agency partners.",

          "description": "SALEM, Ore. — A rulemaking hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 22 at 10 a.m. to gather public input on administrative rules clarifying definitions related to emergency fire and emergency fire costs. Public comment can be made by joining the Zoom meeting link. See the notice of proposed rulemaking for draft rule language. \nThe proposed revisions clarify existing language and include recommendations made to the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) by Macias Gini & O'Connell LLP (MGO), an independent third-party contractor, that reviewed ODF’s financial practices. The proposed amended administrative rules ensure the true costs of wildland suppression costs are accurately accounted for, tracked, reported, and paid for at the statewide level.\nComments can also be sent to nancy.hirsch@odf.oregon.gov until 5 p.m. on Oct. 31. Please clarify which rule your comments pertain to in your email.\nFor additional information, please visit ODF’s proposed laws & rules website.",
