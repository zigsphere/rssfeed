          "description": "THE DALLES, Ore. – The Great Basin Complex Incident Management Team 6, led by Incident Commander Mack McFarland, assumed command of the Microwave Tower Fire at 6:00 a.m. this morning, Wednesday, July 24, 2024. The Complex Incident Management Team brings additional resources and management capabilities to implement a full suppression strategy for the Microwave Tower Fire. \nThe fire has seen moderate activity with intermittent single tree torching, some flanking and smoldering creating a moderate amount of smoke. The fire also saw growth backing down the north slope. With the expected increased winds today, crews are ready to address increased fire behavior. There is a potential for increased smoke in the area.\nMore accurate mapping has sized the fire at 704 acres and 0% containment. The fire is located 5 miles west, southwest of Mosier, OR. Currently there are approximately 72 personnel assigned to the fire. They are building a combination of dozer and hand line on the southern edge to contain the fire.

          "description": "THE DALLES, Ore. – Crews worked through the night on the Microwave Tower fire near Mosier, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures and higher humidity. Much of the progress was along the southern portion of the fire, while the northern portion continues to present challenges due to limited access and steep slopes. Air resources played a critical role in helping slow the fire’s spread in difficult terrain.\nThe fire is currently being mapped, but early indications show that it is roughly 591 acres. Currently, the fire is backing down north facing slopes just west of Mosier, and smoke is visible from I-84.\nToday, winds are predicted to be calmer than yesterday, allowing firefighters a good opportunity to continue the progress from last night. The Type 1 Great Basin National Team currently managing the Whiskey Creek Fire in Hood River County will assume command from Oregon Department of Forestry Central Oregon District tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. The incident command post will be at the Hood River High School.\nEvacuation levels have not changed since the last Wasco County Sheriff’s update at 10 p.m. yesterday. The gymnasium at the Hood River Middle School is a designated Red Cross Shelter for those evacuating.\nLEVEL 3 - GO NOW! Evacuate immediately from Hwy 30 south the Proctor Rd., east to Huskey Rd and the border of the City of Mosier and west to the Hood River County line.\nLEVEL 2 - GET SET from the City of Mosier and Huskey Rd., south to Wilson Rd., and east to Mosier Creek Rd.\nLEVEL 1 - GET READY from Mosier Creek Rd., east to Dry Creek Rd., north to the City of Mosier border and south to Osborn Cutoff Rd.\nFor the most up-to-date evacuation information, please visit the Wasco County Sheriff’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/WascoCountySheriff/",
